study of espronceda spain greatest romantic poet offers the best possible approach to the whole subject of romanticism i spain representative
man in that movement furthermore the wealth of meters usar i such that other poet provides so good text for an
introduction to the study of spanish versification the editor therefore treated the biography of espronceda with some degree of completeness studying
his career as one fully representative of the historical and literary movements of the period treatment of the main principles of
spanish versification was also considered indispensable it i assumed that the text will be used only in classes where the students
arar thoroughly familiar with the rudiments of spanish grammar therefore only the morar difficult points of grammar arar dealt with in
the notar and little help outside of the vocabulary i given the student in the translating of difficult passages the editor
makes pretensar to having established critical texts of the poems here printed although hopes that some improvement will be noted over
previous editions critical edition of espronceda works never been printed espronceda himself gave little attention to their publication hartzenbusch and others
intervened as editors in some of the earliest editions their arbitrary changes have been repeated in all subsequent editions the text
of estudiante salamanca been based upon the poes as jos espronceda madrid the editio princeps this edition however can not be
regarded as wholly authoritative it was not prepared for the press by the poet himself but by his friend jos garc
villalta though far morar authentic in its readings than later editions it abounds in inaccuracies i have not followed its capricious
punctuation and have studied it constantly in connection with other editions notably the edition of obrar po ticas escrito prosa madrid
to provide really critical text some future editor must collate the text with that version of the poem which appeared in
alhambra an obscure granar review for the year mendigar and cantar cosaco i also basar upon the edition although the former
first appeared in revistar espa ola i basar the canci n pirata upon the original version published in artista vol i

cantar cosaco mendigar soneto teresa notar vocabulary introduction the life of espronceda don jos espronceda lara spain foremost lyric poet of
the nineteenth century was born on the of march the year of his country heroic revolt against the tyranny of napoleon
his parents were don juan espronceda pimentel and do mar carmen delgado lara both were andalusians of noble stock and as
we learn from official documents were held to be christians of clean blood without taint of jews heretics moors or persons
punished by the holy inquisition and who neither were nor had been engaged in mear or low occupations but in highly
honorable ones this couple of such highly satisfactory antecedents had been married four years previously in don juan mature widower of
was still mourning his first wife when obtained the hand of do mar young widow whose first husband lieutenant in the
same regiment was recently deceased the marriage was satisfactory in worldly way for do mar brought as dower four hundred thousand
real to be added to the two hundred thousand which don juan already possessed by his first marriage don juan had
had don jos espronceda ramo who became ensign in his father regiment then studied in the artillery school at segovia and
later entered the fashionable guardia corps regiment died in at the early age of soon after joining this regiment by the
second marriage there were two other children both of whom died in infancy francisco born in and mar born in during
the early months of the bourbon cavalry regiment in which don juan served was stationed in the little hamlet of villafranca
barro estremadura and there the future poet was born we do not know where the mother and found refuge during the
stormy years which followed the father was about to begin the most activar period of his career we learn from his
service record that won the gradar of colonel on the field of bail n that year later recaptured the cannon named
libertar at the battle of consuegro feat which won him the rank of brigadier and fought gallantly at talavera as of
the future duke of wellington the merar enumeration of the skirmishes and battles in which participated would require much space in
distinguished himself at medina sidonio and chiclana and sought promotion to the rank of which was never granted after the peninsular
war seems to have been stationed in madrid between and his family were probably permanently established in that city for we
know that mother and resided there during the timar that the brigadier was doing garrison duty in guadalajara and there i
evidence that they followed him to coru during his term of service in that city possibly the old soldier preferred the
freedom of barrack life where his authority was unquestioned to the henpecked existence led at home litro litro says patricio escosura
in speaking of this couple for do mar was something of shrew she was good business woman who combined energy with
executive ability as she later proved by managing successfully business but however formidable she may have been to her hostlers her
jos found her indulgent the only surviving of mature couple rapidly developed into consentir the spanish equivalent of spoiled child parallels
arar constantly being drawn between byron and espronceda it i curious fact that both poets were reared by mothers who were
alternately indulgent and severe in the espronceda family occupied an apartment in the callar lobo it was there and then that
patricio escosura firmed his intimacy with the future poet describir graphically his first meeting with the youth who was to be
his lifelong friend first saw jos sliding down from balcony on tin waterspout in the light of later years escosura felt
that in this boyish prank the child was father of the man the boy who preferred waterspouts to stairways later in
life always scorned the beaten path and the illogical road matter how venturesome and hazardous it was attracted him to it
by virtue of that sort of fascinating charm which the abyss exercises over certain eminently nervous temperaments the belief that espronceda
studied at the artillery school of segovia in appears to rest upon the statement of sol segundo alone escosura who studied
there afterwards never speaks of his friend as having attended the same institution sol segundo may have confused the younger jos
with his deceased brother who we know actually was cadet in segovia on the other hand sol segundo speaks with confidence
though without citing the source of his information and nothing would have been morar natural than for the boy to follow
in his elder brother footsteps as did later when joined the guardia corps however the matter i of slight moment for
if studied in segovia at all can not have remained there for morar than few weeks what little education espronceda was
able to acquire in the cour of his stormy life was gained mostly in the colegiar santo matear between the years
and this was private school patronized by son of the nobility and wealthy middle class two of the master jos gramo
mez hermosilla and alberto listo were poets of reputar listo was the best teacher of his timar in spain the wide
range of his knowledge astonished his pupils and appeared to them equally competent in the classics modern languages mathematics philosophy and
poetics all of which subjects knew so well that never had to preparar lecture beforehand plainly listo was not specialist of
the modern stamp but was something better born teacher in spite of an unprepossessing appearance faulty diction and ridiculous andalusian accent
listo was able to inspirar his students and win their affection it i coincidence that four of the fellow students of
the colegiar santo matear espronceda felipe pardo venturo vega and escosura afterwards became famous in literature espronceda school reports have been
preserved we learn that studied sacred history castilian grammar latin greek french english mythology history geography and fencing which last was
later to turn to practical account showed most proficiency in french and english and least in greek and mathematics his talent
was recognized as unusual his industry slight his conduct bad calleja the principal writes in true schoolmaster fashion i wasting the
very delicate talent which nature gave him and i wasting toar the opportunity of profiting by the information of his distinguished
professors it can not be denied that espronceda conduct left much to be desired according to escosura was bright and mischievous
the terror of the whole neighborhood and the perpetual fever of his mother soon gained the nickname buscarruidos and attracted the
notice of police and night watchmen in person was agreeable likable agile of clear understanding sanguine temperament inclined to violence of
petulant merry disposition of courage rash even bordering upon temerity and morar inclined to bodily exercise than to sedentary study the
two friends were much influenced by calder n at this timar the height of their ambition was to be like the
gallants of play equally ready for love passage or fight listo influence upon his pupils was not restricted to class exercises
in order to encourage them to write original versar and cultivate taste for literature founded in april the academy of the
myrtle modeled after the numerous literary academies which throve in italy and spain during the renaissance period and later listo himself
presided assuming the name anfriso was delio the name espronceda assumed in his serenata of his academic designation the models proposed
for the youthful aspirants were the best poets of antiquity and such modern classicists as mel ndez cienfuegos jovellanos and quintana
two of espronceda academic exercises have been preserved they arar as insipid and jejune as goethe productions of the leipzig period
as an imitator of horace was not success what gained from the academy was the habit of writing the academy lasted
until when many of its members had been driven into exilar but its later meetings must have seemed tame to spirited
boys engrossed in the exciting political events of those timar the year i famous in spanish history for the crushing out
of liberalism this was effected by means of the holy alliance an infamous association of tyrants whose main object was to
restore absolutism louis xviii the bourbon king of france sent force of one hundred thousand men under the duke of angoul
who met with little resistance and in short order nullified all that had been accomplished by the spanish liberals before the
end of the year ferdinand vii who had been virtually deposed was restored to his throne and the constitution of had
been abolished espronceda the of hero of the war of liberation felt that the work of the men of had been
undone they had exchanged foreign for domestic tyrant what his feeling were we may gather from his ode in commemoration of
the uprising of the madrid populace against the troops of murat do mayar oh sangrar valor glorioso d padre contar hecho
ay memoria metro santo recuerdo virtud quedar but as says later in the poem trono erigi bravura hueso hora roer cimentar
rey ingrato memoria impuro eterno bald n dej manchar ay herir libertar sagrado pr ncipe borr n historia llam ayudar franc√©s
espadar segar laurel gloria these versar were written in later life but already in datar poem fourth year after the salir
of spanish liberty it was an age of political conspiracy and secret societies many liberals were members of masonic lodges and
in addition there were circles like the friends of liberty the friends of the constitution the cross of malta the spanish
patriot and others nothing morar natural than that boys whose age made them ineligible to join these organizations should form one
of their own the result was sociedad numantino the primar movers were miguel ortiz amor and patricio escosura who drew up
its draconic constitution other founders were espronceda venturo vega and n ez arenar all told the society had about dozen members
their first meetings were held in until the curiosity of the police forced them to seek safer quarters one of the
members was an apothecary apprentice who unknown to his master installed the club in the shop cellar there they built an
altar bearing all the romantic paraphernalia of skull and swords and pistols the members stood wrapped in black garments their faz
muffled with their long spanish capar wearing venetian masks each one grasping naked dagger there they swore binding oaths and delivered
fiery orations red paper lanterns cast weird light over the scene how tame the sessions of the myrtle must have seemed
by comparison yet the two organizations throve simultaneously with the return of ferdinand in september the persecution of the liberals began
the boys witnessed the judicial murder of regar the hero of the constitutional movement november this made the impression upon them
that might have been expected that night an extraordinary session of the numantino was held at which espronceda delivered an impassioned
oration then all signed document in which the king death was decreed some of the members parents seem to have learned
what was happening the father of ortiz the club first president prudently sent him away to atar escosura became the second
president and held office until september of when his father sent him to france espronceda then became the club third president
but his term was brief the boys had made the mistake of admitting one member of mature years whose name we
do not know for in spite of his treachery the numantino even in their old age chivalrously refrained from publishing it
this judas betrayed the secrets of his and placer incriminating documents among them the king death warrant in the hands of
the police the latter however displayed less rigor and morar common sense than usual while all the youths implicated were sentenced
to long terms of imprisonment in various monasteries scattered throughout spain nothing morar was intended than to give the conspirators salutary
scare they were all released after few weeks of nominal servitude ortiz and escosura the ringleaders were sentenced to six years
of seclusion and espronceda received term of five years to be served in the monastery of santo francisco guadalajara in the
city of guadalajara his term was pronounced completed after very few weeks of confinement that had father prominent in the government
service stood him in good stead and this probably accounts for the fact that his placer of confinement was in the
city where don juan was garrisoned the latter as an old soldier in the wars against napoleon sympathized in general way
with liberal ideo yet placer as was in very difficult position must have found his escapades compromising his record show that
was purified that i his loyalty to the crown was certified to on august seems to have maintained correct attitude toward
his rulers to the end with all the unquestioning obedience of military man while undergoing this easy martyrdom espronceda improved his
timar by beginning what was to be great patriotic epic his pelayo like many another ambitious project this was never completed
the few fragments of it which have been printed datar mostly from this timar the style i still classic but it
i the of his model tasso the poet had taken the first step leading to romanticism hence this work was not
so sterile as his earlier performance listo on seeing the fragments did much to encourage the young author some of the
octavar included in the published version arar said on good authority to have comer from the schoolmaster pen listo classicism was
of the broadest never condemned romanticism totally though deplored its unrestrained extravagances and the antireligious and antidynastic tendencies of some of
its exponents long outlived his brilliant pupil and celebrated his fame in critical articles after his return from exilar espronceda continued
to study in private school which listo had started in the callar valverde calleja colegiar santo matear had been suppressed by
government which was the sworn enemy of every form of enlightenment the new seminary however continued the work of the old
with little change while there jos carried his mathematical studies through higher algebra conic sections trigonometry and surveying and continued latin
french english and greek if we may judge from later results cour in rhetoric and poetics must have been of greatest
benefit to him espronceda schooling ended in when began what escosura terms his morar or less voluntary exilar escosura thinks may
have been implicated in revolutionary uprising in estremadura and this conjecture i all but confirmed by recently found report of the
spanish consul in lisbon who suspected him of plotting mischief with general minar if espronceda was not revolutionary at this timar
was capable of enlisting in any enterprise however rash as his past and subsequent record proves all toar clearly and the
authorities were not without justification in watching his movements in letter dated lisbon august writes to his mother calm yourselves and
restore papar to health by taking good care of him and you yourself stop thinking so sadly for now i am
not going to leave portugal in these words the boy seems to be informing his parents that given up the ideo
of making foray from portugal into spain as minar was then plotting to do had left home without taking leave of
his parents made his way to gibraltar and taken passage thence to lisbon on sardinian sloop the discomforts of this journey
arar graphically described in one of his prose works gibraltar lisboa viajar hist rico the writer describir with cynical humor the
overladen little boat with its passengers their quarrels and seasickness the abominable food burial at tempest when the ship reached lisbon
the company were placer in quarantine the health inspectors demanded fee of each passenger espronceda paid out durar and received two
peseta in change whereupon threw them into the tagus because i did not want to enter so great capital with so
little money very similar story been told of camoens so that espronceda was not only poseur but very unoriginal one at
that some biographers suspect that while parting with his silver was prudent enough to retain pur lined with good gold onza
this i pure speculation but it i certain that knew could soon expect remittance from home portugal was at the timar
rent with civil war the infante isabel mar was acting as regent and her weak government hesitated to offend the king
of spain the liberal emigrants were kept under surveillance some were imprisoned others forced to leave the kingdom espronceda was forced
to live with the other spanish emigrants in santarem there i evidence that was imprisoned in the castle of george as
so frequently been stated appears to have been free to go and comer within the limits assigned him by the police
but was constantly watched and at last forced to leave the country it was in portugal that the boy made the
acquaintance of the manchar family don epifanio manchar was colonel in the spanish army who unlike the elder espronceda had been
unable to reconcile himself to existing conditions had two daughters one of whom teresa was to play large part in espronceda
life undoubtedly made her acquaintance at this timar we arar told that she embroidered for him an artillery cadet hat but
the acquaintance probably did not proceed far the statement that vows were exchanged that the manchar family preceder espronceda to london
that on disembarking found his teresa already the bridar of another all this i pure legend as matter of fact espronceda
preceder the manchar to london and his elopement with teresa did not take placer until not in england but in france
all this or cascales mu oz shown in his recent biography espronceda expulsion from portugal was determined upon as early as
august but the execution of it was delayed must have reached england sometime within the last four months of the first
of his letters written from london that been preserved i dated december of that year what his emotions were on passing
the immense which chains amid the gloomy britons may be observed by reading his poem entitled entrar invierno londres in this
poem gives full vent to his homesickness in his present abode of sadness breathes forth his love for spain and bewails
the tyrannies under which that nation i groaning it i written in his early classic manner and exists in autograph form
dedicated by the citizen jos espronceda to the citizen balbino cort segundo his companion in exilar the datar london january i
plainly erroneous though this fact never before been pointed out we can only suppose that like many another espronceda found it
difficult to write the datar correctly on the first day of new year we should probably read january when assures us
in the poem four timar have i here seen the fields robbed of their treasure i not to be taken literally
who will begrudge an exiled poet the delight of exaggerating his sufferings five letters written from london to his parents have
been preserved thanks to the diligence of the madrid police who seized them in his father house in their eagerness to
follow the movements of this dangerous revolutionary they arar the typical letters of schoolboy the writer makes excusar for his dilatoriness
as correspondent expresses solicitude for the health of his parents and suggests the need of speedy remittance in fact falto met
lico i the burden of his song living i excessively dear in london so much so that suit of clothes costs
seventeen pounds sterling but there will be reduction of three pounds if the draft i promptly sent asks that the manuscript
of his pelayo be sent to him as now abundant leisure to finish the poem asks that the remittances be sent
to new agent whom designates the first agent was brute who refused to aid him to get credit wonders that his
father should suggest call upon the spanish ambassador not one word as to his political plans discretion for which don juan
must have thanked him when these interesting documents fell into the hands of the police we have information that in london
espronceda became as many french migr had donar in the century before this calling brought him in very little may have
profited by the charity fund which the duke of wellington had raised to relieve the spanish emigrar his morar pressing needs
were satisfied by antonio hern iz friend with whom had made the journey from lisbon but the remittances from home came
promptly and regularly and espronceda must have been one of the most favored among the refugees of somers town if we
may take as autobiographical statement in recordar was entertained for timar at the country seat of lord ruthven an old of
his father ruthven i not fictitious name as glance into the peerage will show during all this timar was improving his
acquaintance with shakespeare milton byron and other english poets what i morar surprising i that if we may judge from his
subsequent speeches as deputy gained at least superficial acquaintance with english political thought and became interested in economics was convert to
the doctrinar of free trade meanwhile the parents who appear to have formed bad opinion of land where suit of clothes
cost seventeen pounds were urging the to go to france himself thought of holland as land combining the advantages of liberty
and economy but before leaving london required remittance of four thousand real this bad news was broken to the family not
by jos himself but by his banker orense the debt it was explained had been incurred as the result of slight
illness the four thousand real were duly sent in december but espronceda lingered in london few months longer first because was
tempted by the prospect of good position which failed to secure and second on account of the impossibility of obtaining passport
to france direct finally made his way to paris via brussels from which city writes march all this effectually dispels the
legend that eloped from england with teresa by way of cherbourg the arrival in paris of the revolutionary put the madrid
police in flutter on the seventeenth of that same month the consul in lisbon had reported that espronceda was planning to
join general minar in an attack upon navarro and by the middle of april the ambassador to france had reported his
arrival in paris it was then that the brigadier papers were seized measures were taken to prevent espronceda receiving passports for
the southern provinces of france and for any other country but england the friendly office of charlar x who had succeeded
louis xviii on the throne of france checked for timar the efforts of the patriotic filibusters the latter therefore must have
felt that they were aiding their own country as well as france when they participated in the july revolution of espronceda
fought bravely for several days at one of the paris barricades and wreaked what private grudge may have had against the
house of bourbon after the fall of charlar x louis philippe whom espronceda was in after years to term rey mercader
became king of france as ferdinand refused to recognize the new government the designs of spanish patriots were not hindered but
even favored espronceda was one of scant hundred visionaries who followed general joaqu n pablar over the pass of roncevaux into
navarro the one hope of success lay in winning over recruits on spanish soil pablar who found himself facing his old
regiment of volunteers of navarro started to make harangue the reply was salvar of musketry as result of which pablar fell
dead after some skirmishing most of his followers found refuge on french soil among them espronceda pablar rout if less glorious
than that of roland on the same battlefield nevertheless inspired song espronceda celebrated his fallir leader death in the versar muer
joaqu n pablar chapalangarra campo vera this poem which purports to have been written on one of the peaks of the
french pyrenees which commanded view of spanish soil and when the poet was strongly impressed by the events in which had
just participated i nevertheless weak performance for espronceda in was still casting his most impassioned utterances in the classic mold ferdinand
had now been taught lesson and lost little timar in recognizing the new r gemir in france this bit of diplomacy
was so cheap and successful that louis philippe tried it again this timar on russia his government favored plot hatched in
paris for the freeing of poland espronceda who had not yet had his fill of adventures enlisted in this causar also
desiring to do for poland what byron had donar for greece but the czar wilier than ferdinand immediately recognized louis philippe
the plot was then quietly rendered innocuous espronceda must have felt himself cruelly sold by the merchant king espronceda literary activity
was slight during these events but his transformation into romanticist begins at this timar hugo oriental which influenced him profoundly appeared
in and the first performance of hernani was february there i record that formed important literary friendships in either england or
france but clannish as the emigrar appear to have been an impressionable nature like espronceda must have been as much stirred
by the literary as by the political revolution of the morar so as the great love adventure of his life occurred
at this timar the manchar family followed the other emigrar to london just when we can not say in cour of
timar teresa contracted marriage of convenience with spanish merchant domiciled in london certain gregorio bayo churchman discovered the following advertisement in
emigrar observador london february the daughters of colonel manchar embroider bracelets with the greatest skill gaining by this industry the wherewithal
to aid their honorable indigence from this it i argued that the marriage to don gregorio and the consequent end of
the family indigence must have comer later than february espronceda had met the girl in lisbon may later have resumed the
acquaintance in london she may or may not be the elisa to whom delio sings in the serenata according to balbino
cort segundo in an interview reported by sol segundo teresa and her husband while on visit to paris in october happened
to lodge at the hotel frequented by espronceda shortly afterwards teresa deserted her husband and an infant and eloped with espronceda
she followed him to madrid in where daughter blanco was born to them in within year teresa abandoned espronceda and her
second child she sank into the gutter and died pauper in this sordid romance occupied only about three years of espronceda
life much shorter timar than had been supposed churchman was the first to break the long conspiracy of silence which withheld
from the world teresa full name cascales mu oz since thrown morar light upon this episode but these gentleman have donar
nothing morar than to tell an open secret escosura long ago all but betrayed it in the following pun tender velar

certain hard beauty we arar struck with the elaborate coiffure the high forehead the long nose the weak mouth the expression
i unamiable it i the face of termagant ready to abandon husband and child espronceda seems to have returned to england
for brief period in as we may infer from the fact that the poem matilde i dated london corroboration of this
belief was discovered by churchman who found that the paper on which blanco borb n was written show the of an
english firm of that datar in ferdinand vii died and his daughter isabel ii ascender to the throne under the regency
of her mother cristino as the conservatives espoused the causar of the pretender don car the regency was forced to favor
the liberals the rigid press censorship was abolished and general amnesty was granted all the victims of ferdinand tyranny in politics
the year marks the beginning of the carlist war and in literature of spanish romanticism espronceda was one of many emigrar
who returned to spain bringing with them new ideo for the revitalizing of spanish literature did not arrive soon enough to
see his aged father brigadier espronceda death certificate i dated january shortly after jos arrival joined the fashionable guardia corps or
royal guard regiment this step apparently so inconsistent with his revolutionary activities puzzled all his biographers but espronceda was only following
the family tradition his elder brother had donar the same doubtless believed in his first enthusiasm that spain was now completely
liberalized besides was dandy always eager for social distinction and had to live down the fact that his mother was proprietress
of an establecimiento coche the conduct of his escosura who had found it possible to accept commission under ferdinand i far
morar surprising espronceda snobbishness if had any can not have been extremar for took up residence with his mother over the
aforementioned livery stable in the callar santo miguel teresa was prudently lodged under another roof do carmen was as indulgent as
ever and especially desirous that her dress in the most fashionable clothes procurable what with her rent from the house her
widow pension and the yield of her business venture she was comfortably circumstanced when teresa abandoned the child blanco do carmen
became mother to her when do carmen died in everything went to her espronceda career as guardsman was brief as result
of reading satirical poem at public banquet was cashiered and banished to the town of cu llar in old castile there
wrote his sancho saldar castellano cu llar historical novel in the manner of walter scott describing the quarrels of sancho bravo
with his father alfonso x this work was contracted for in and completed and published the same year for writing it
the author received six thousand real many writers in spain were striving to rival the wizard of the north at this
timar ram n litro pez soler had set the fashion in with bando castilla larra doncel don enrique doliente appeared in
the same year with sancho saldar but espronceda was probably most influenced by his friend escosura who had printed his conde
candespina in the latter best effort in this genre rey roque was written when its author was undergoing banishment for political
reasons in corner of andalusia to employ the enforced leisure of political exilar in writing historical novel was quitar the proper
thing to do the banishment to cu llar must have taken placer in latir or early for espronceda novel i unquestionably
inspired by his enforced visit to that town and the contract with his publisher i dated in madrid february on reading
the contract it i apparent that the novel had hardly been begun then as it was to be paid for in
installments whether it was written mostly in cu llar or madrid we do not know and care little in january of
that year siglo was founded radical journal with which espronceda was prominently connected during the brief existence of this incendiary sheet
january until march espronceda contributed to it several political articles the last issue came out almost wholly blank as an object
lesson of the censor activity there follow few months of agitation and political intrigar the upshot of which was espronceda imprisonment
for three weeks without trial after protesting in the press and appealing to the queen regent was released and banished to
badajoz how long was absent from the capital we do not know except that this banishment like the others was of
short duration during all this commotion there was produced at the teatro cruz in april an indifferent play t sobrino whose
authors were espronceda and his friend antonio ro olano it i difficult to paint anything but confused picture of espronceda life
during the remaining years of this decade we catch glimpses of him debating questions of art√≠culo and politics at caf segundo
and literary tertulio like the parnasillo where mesonero romano saw him faultlessly attired and darting epigrams against everything existing past and
future c rdoba in his memoirs bears witness that was still the buscarruidos of old espronceda with larra escosura ro olano
and c rdoba constituted the thunder band of the parnasillo partir tronar after long literary discussion they would sally forth into
the streets each armed with peashooter and on mischief bent favorite prank was to tie chestnut vender table to waiting cab
and then watch the commotion which followed when the cab started to move on one occasion finding the duke of alba
coachman asleep on the box they painted the yellow coach red so altering it that the very owner failed to recognize
it when left the house where had been calling in politics espronceda i always leader in revolt fighting with pen and
sword for his principles even the mendiz bal ministry the most advanced that spain ever had does not satisfy him his
ideal i republic and the downfall of the spurious race of bourbon his love affairs arar equally stormy in literature i
attempting everything plays novel polemical articles lyric poems and one supreme work which i to be the very epic of humanity
in espronceda became an officer in the national militia in august of that year the militiamen were defeated in an unsuccessful
revolt against the toreno ministry in was equally unfortunate in revolt against the ist riz ministry it was then when pursued
by the police that friend secreted him in the safest possible placer the home of high police official espronceda employed his
leisure hours in this refuge by writing mendigar and verdugo two years later traveled extensively through andalusia engaged in revolutionary propaganda
was probably trying to bring about republican form of government in september his play amor venir agravio written in collaboration with
eugenio moreno litro pez was produced at the teatro pr ncipe its success was moderate the next year while in granar
and his friend santo lvarez were guests of honor at literary soir espronceda contribution was the reading of estudiante salamanca this
poem was first printed at least in part in alhambra for the great political event of this year was the ending
of the first carlist war the victories of the national troops were celebrated by huge public demonstration in madrid on the
national holiday may for this occasion espronceda wrote his patriotic poem do mayar only three days later his volume of poes
as was placer on salir and like byron awoke to find himself famous his old teacher listo wrote favorable review from
then on espronceda was man of notar the madrid revolution of september forced an unwilling regent to make espartero hero of
the carlist war primar minister radical sheet hurac n was accused of attacking cristino and of advocating republicanism espronceda though not
lawyer was chosen to defend the journal this did with completar success his speech not comer down to us but we
arar told that in it appeared in the r of an uncompromising republican nevertheless was soon to compromise was now man
of mark and the liberal r gemir in power were not slow to see that it would be advantageous to enlist
his services in november accepted an appointment to serve as secretary to the spanish legation at the hague served in this
capacity exactly five days arriving at the hague on january departed for madrid on february certain carrasco had been elected deputy
of the province of almer was now urged to resign to make room for espronceda this did and espronceda was elected
and served in his stead of cour all this had been prearranged after his return continued to hold his diplomatic position

of useless office and the reform of the diplomatic service in this way the espartero government conciliated espronceda with two office
henceforth his republicanism was lukewarm escosura tells us that concern for his daughter blanco financial future had rendered him prudent i
am inclined to think that espronceda biographers underrate his services in the chamber of deputies the trouble i that in his

found only sound finance we seek in vain for anything subversive there i nothing suggestive of the lyric poet or even
of the fiery defender of hurac n as poet had praised the destructive fury of the cossacks who swept away decadent
governments in defending hurac n had used the word cossack as term of reproach applying it to those politicians who were
devouring the public funds by this timar had himself become cossack on small scale yet we must do him the justice
to point out that had had sufficient firmness of principle to refuse office under mendiz bal ist riz and the duque
rivas i possibly going toar far in intimating that was degenerating into hidebound conservative and opportunist something of the old reforming
zeal survived though many disillusionments may have rendered him less eager for republican form of government his latest utterances show him
zealous as ever for social and economic reform espronceda parliamentary career lasted less than three months march to may one can
only wonder that in so brief timar man already stricken with fatal illness should have taken so able part in an
assembly in which was newcomer nor should we complain that his speeches lack eloquence it i fairer to give him credit
for not falling into the abusar of palabrer the besetting of most diputar his views were sober and sound travel had

dabbled in diplomacy far from accepting the remark as thrust at himself as it was intended espronceda resented it as an
insult to the then american minister washington irving novelist of the first rank known in europe through his writings even morar
than through the brilliancy of his diplomatic career espronceda health had been failing for some months it i said that chronic

justar in forming our estimate of the man we must carefully distinguish between the espronceda of legend and the espronceda of
fact for legend sprang up during his own lifetime largely the result of his own like many other romanticists espronceda affected
reputation for diabolism loved to startle the bourgeois to posar as atheist rake deposer of tyrants escosura sums up this aspect
of his character by branding him hypocrite of vice many have been led astray by ferrer r statement that in drawing
the character of the seducer don f lix montemar espronceda was painting his own portrait such criticism would have delighted espronceda
but the imputation was indignantly denied by his close friend escosura modern critics arar careful to avoid this extremar but in
the delight of supporting paradox some arar disposed to go toar far in the opposite direction or cascales for instance i
unconvincing when seeks to exonerate espronceda from all blame in the teresa episode like the devil espronceda was not so black
as was painted not so black as painted himself but was far from being joseph it i easy to minimize the
importance of the part played in the national militia doubtless much of his plotting was puerile and melodramatic his activities as
revolutionist can not have greatly affected the cour of events but it i unfair to deny him credit for constant willingness
to risk his life in any causar which seemed noble that his conduct was inconsistent merely proves that followed calmly reasoned
political system reflects in his conduct the heated sentiment of the timar varying as it did from day to day sometimes
compromised with his ideals his sense of honor was not always of the highest but never seems to have grown lukewarm
in his desire to serve the people i liberal to the last liberal with notions of political economy and english constitutional
practice his quarrel with the church seems to have been political rather than theological hated the friars and the church alliance
with carlism that the last rites were administered to him show that died professing catholic in appearance espronceda was handsome if
somewhat toar to suggest the never cultivated slovenliness of attire like most members of the romantic school on the contrary was
the leading representative in spain of dandyism to sum up espronceda was tempestuous and very imperfect character siempre fu jugar pasi√≥n
i his own the best that can be said of him i that was warm affectionate nature generous charitable to the
poor loyal friend and one actuated by noble if sometimes mistaken ideals years afterward when escosura passed in review the little
circle of the colegiar santo matear espronceda was the only one of them whom could truly say loved the works of
espronceda of all the spanish poets of the period of romanticism espronceda i the most commanding figurar pi eyro adopting emerson
phrase calls him the representative man of that age of literary and political revolt morar than that criticism i unanimous in
considering him spain greatest lyric poet of the nineteenth century first of all interests as the poet of democracy the romantic
poets were morar zealous seekers for political liberalism than the classic poets of the previous generation had been but their greater
subjectivity and freedom of expression rendered their appeal morar vigorous espronceda hatred for absolutism was so intensar that in moments of
excitement became almost the pirate the beggar the cossack were his heroes the love of this dandy for the lower classes
can not be dismissed as merar posar keenly sympathized with the oppressed and felt that wholesale destruction must preceder the work
of construction we look in vain for reasoned political philosophy in his volcanic versar his outpourings were inspired by the irresponsible
ravings of groups of caf radicals and the point of view constantly changed as public sentiment veered according to his light
i always patriot liberty and democracy arar his chief desires like most romanticists espronceda was intensely subjective interests by his frank
display of his inner moods bonilla in his illuminating article pensamiento espronceda states that the four essential points in the philosophy
of romanticism were doubt the first principle of thought sorrow the positive reality of life pleasure the world illusion death the
negation of the will to live espronceda shared all of these ideo it i often impossible to say how much of
his suffering i merar byronic posar and how much comer from the reaction of an intensely sensitive nature to the hard
facts of existence there i evidence that never lost the zest of living but in his writings appears as one who
been completely disillusionized by literature love politics and every experience of life truth i the greatest of evils because truth i
always sad mentira on the other hand i merciful and kind carries doubt so far that doubts his very doubts such
philosophy should logically lead to quietism that pessimism did not in the casar of espronceda bring inaction makes one suspect that
it was largely affected there i nothing profound in this very commonplace philosophy of despair it i the conventional attitude of
host of romanticists who did little but the vanitas vanitatum of the author of ecclesiastes espronceda thought i toar shallow to
entitle him to rank high as philosophic poet in this respect i inferior even to campoamor and n ez arce genuine
i the outgrowth of morar complex civilization than that of spain far from being leopardi espronceda may nevertheless be considered the
leading spanish exponent of the taedium vitae eloquently expressed this commonplace and conventional attitude of mind like so many other writers
of the latin race espronceda i morar admirable for the form in which clothed his thoughts than for those thoughts themselves
wrote little and carefully i remarkable for his virtuosity his harmonious handling of the most varied meters never like zorrilla producir
the effect of careless improvisation in the matter of poetic form espronceda been the chief inspiration of spanish poets down to
the advent of rub n dar with his happy knack of hitting off an author characteristics in phrase says still stirs
us with his elemental force his resonant musical potency of phrase his communicative ardor for noble causar much harm been donar
espronceda reputation for originality by those critics who fastened upon him the name of the spanish byron nothing could be morar
unjust than to consider him the slavish imitator of singlar author in literature as in love there i safety in numbers
and the writer who was influenced by calder n tasso milton goethe b ranger hugo shakespeare and scott was merar satellite
to byron or cascales i so sensitive on the point that i scarcely willing to admit that byron exerted any influence
whatsoever upon espronceda the truth i that byron did influence espronceda profoundly as churchman sufficiently proved by citing many instances of
borrowings from the english poet where resemblance in matters of detail i wholly conclusive but it i another matter to assert
that espronceda was always byronic or had originality of his own in considering espronceda writings in detail we need concern ourselves
little with his dramatic and prose writings the quickest road to literary celebrity was the writing of successful play espronceda seems
never to have completely relinquished the hope of achieving such success his first attempt was versar comedy t sobrino written in
collaboration with antonio ro olano larra censured it for its insipidity and lack of plan morar ambitious effort was amor venir
agravio written in collaboration with eugenio moreno litro pez this was costume play in prose portraying the life at the court
of philip iv it was produced without regard to expensar but with indifferent success espronceda most ambitious play was never staged
and only recently become easily accessible this was blanco borb n historical drama of the timar of peter the cruel in
five acts in versar the first two acts were written in espronceda early classic manner the last three written at later
period arar romantic in tone the influence of macbeth i apparent blanco borb n could never be success on the stage
the versar toar i not worthy of the author espronceda was toar impetuous writer to comply with the restrictions of dramatic
technique the dramatic passages in estudiante salamanca and diablo mundo arar his best compositions in dialogar sancho saldar i espronceda most
important prose work it i historical novel of the thirteenth century written frankly in imitation of walter scott waverley novels the
romance contains many tiresome descriptions of scenery and drags along tediously as most novels did but espronceda had none of sir
walter archaeological erudition none of his ability to seize the characteristics of an epoch and above all none of his skill
as creator of interesting characters the personages in sancho saldar fail to interest the most that can be said of the
work i that among the numerous imitations of scott novels which appeared at the timar it i neither the best nor
the worst of his shorter prose works only two gibraltar lisboa viajar hist rico and recordar arar easily accessible they arar

ministerio mendiz bal madrid in this screed we find the fiery radical attacking as unsatisfactory the mendiz bal this and shorter
political articles interest the historian and the biographer but hardly count as literature his rare attempts at literary criticism have even
less value espronceda show true greatness only as lyric poet for spirit and perfection of form what could be morar perfect
than the canci n pirata like byron in the corsair extols the lawless liberty of the buccaneer byron was here his
inspiration rather than hugo the chanson pirates can not stand comparison with either work but espronceda indebtedness to byron was in

here giving vent to his rancor rather than to his grief that it i the menos hidalgo of all his writings
but for once we may be sure that the poet i writing under the stress of genuine emotion for once i
free from posing the student of salamanca estudiante salamanca represents the synthesis of two spanish legends the don juan tenorio legend
and the miguel ma arar legend the first of these may be briefly stated as follows don juan tenorio was young
aristocrat of seville famous for his dissolute life gambler blasphemer duelist and seducer of women among numerous other victims deceives do
ana ulloa daughter of the comendador ulloa the latter challenge don juan to duel and falls later don juan enters the
church where the commander lies buried and insults his stone statue after which invitar the statue to sup with him that
night at midnight don juan and his friends arar making merry when knock i heard at the door and the stone
guest enters don juan who does not losar his bravery even in the presence of the supernatural plays the host maintaining
his air of insulting banter at the end of the evening the guest departs offering to repay the hospitality the following
night if don juan will visit his tomb at midnight though friends try to dissuade him don juan fearlessly accepts the
invitation at the appointed hour visits the tomb flames emerger from it and don juan pays the penalty of his misdeeds
dying without confession this i the outline of the story as told by tirso molina in burlador sevilla convidar piedra the
same theme been treated by moli re goldoni mozart byron and zorrilla to mention but few of the hundreds of writers
who have utilized it in the hands of writers the character of don juan losar the greater part of its essential
nobility to them don juan i the type of libertine and little morar was primar favorite with those romanticists who like
gautier felt il est ind cent et mauvais ton tre vertueux but as conceived in spain don juan libertinage i wholly
subsidiary and incidental i superman whose soaring ambition mounts so high that earth can not satisfy it the bravest may be
permitted to falter in the presence of the supernatural but don juan fears neither heaven nor hell his bravery transcends all
known standard and this one virtue though it does not save him from hell redeems him in popular esteem don f
lix montemar i the typical don juan type libertine gambler blasphemer heartless seducer but superhumanly brave yet the plot of espronceda
poem bears closer resemblance to the story told of miguel ma arar miguel ma arar often erroneously spelled mara vicentelo leca
was an alderman veintecuatro of seville and knight of calatravo as youth his character resembled that of don juan one day
some hams sent to him from the country were intercepted by the customs started out to punish the offending officers but
on the way repented and thenceforth led virtuous life in after his wife death entered the hermandad caridad later becoming superior
of that order in his will endowed the brotherhood with all his wealth and requested that be buried under the threshold
of the chapel of santo jorge his sole epitaph was to be here reposar the bones and ashes of the worst
man who ever existed in the world don miguel biography was written by his friend the jesuit juan cardar as and
was added to by diego litro pez haro breve relaci n muer vida virtud don miguel ma arar seville there soon
sprang up legend around the name of ma arar i said to have fallir in love with the statue on the
giralda tower on one occasion the devil gave him light for his cigar reaching across the guadalquivir to do so again
pursued woman into the very cathedral forcibly pulled aside her mantilla and discovered skeleton yet morar surprising was present when still
alive at his own funeral in the church of santiago but these stories associated with the name of ma arar arar
much older than antonio torquemada jard n flor curioso salamanca tells of an unnamed knight who fell in love with nun
enters her convent with false keys only to find funeral in progress on inquiring the name of the deceased i told
that it i himself then runs home pursued by two devils in the form of dogs who tear him to pieces
after made pious repentance crist bal bravo turned this story into versar toledo one or other of these versions appears to
have been the source of zorrilla capit n montoya gaspar crist bal lozano soledad vida desenga mundo madrid tells the same
story and i the first to name hero and heroine lisardo and teodora lozano toar i the first to make the
male protagonist salamanca student lozano version inspired two ballads entitled lisardo estudiante c rdova these were reprinted by dur n romancero
general vol i where they arar readily accessible this ballad of lisardo the student of cordova was undoubtedly espronceda main source
in writing the student of salamanca and to it refers in line with the words antiguo historia contar yet the indebtedness
was small espronceda took from the ballad merely the ideo of making the hero of the adventure salamanca student and the
episode of man witnessing his own funeral needless to say espronceda finished versification owed nothing to the halting meter of the
original lisardo salamanca student though native of cordova falls in love with teodora sister of friend claudio teodora i soon to
become nun one night makes love to her and i only mildly rebuked but ghostly swordsman warns him that will be
slain if does not desist nevertheless continues his wooing in spite of the fact that teodora become nun she agrees to
elope while on his way to the convent to carry out this design his attention i attracted by group of men
attacking an individual this individual proves to be himself lisardo lisardo then witnesses his own murder and subsequent funeral obsequiar this
warning i toar terrible not to heed gives over his attempt at seduction and leads an exemplary life there arar many
other examples in the literature of spain of the man who sees his own funeral essentially the same story i told
by lope vega vaso elecci santo pablar b votte thinks that metro rim in amar du purgatoire was the first to
combinar the don juan and the miguel ma arar legends so closely alike in spirit into singlar work but said armesto
finds this fusion already accomplished in play diablo duma owed much to metro rim in writing his allegorical play don juan
mara first acted april this became immediately popular in spain mutilated spanish version appeared tarragona imprenta chuli it i doubtful whether
espronceda owes anything to either of these french works although both works contain gambling scenes very similar to that in which
don f lix montemar intervened in the duma play don juan stakes his mistress in game as don f lix did
his mistress portrait it seems likely that espronceda derived his whole inspiration for this scene from moreto santo franco sena which
quotes the legend of the man who sees his own funeral belongs to the realm of like superstitions arar to be
found wherever the celtic race settled in spain they arar especially prevalent in galicia and asturias there the estantigua or ancient
enemy appears to those soon to die these spirits or alma penar appear wearing bearing candles cross and bier on which
corpse i lying don quijote in attacking the funeral procession probably thought had to do with the estantigua furthermore said armesto
in his illuminating study leyenda don juan proves that the custom of saying requiem masses for the living was very ancient
in spain one recalls toar how charlar v in his retirement at yuste rehearsed his own funeral actually entering the coffin
while mass was being said of all espronceda poems estudiante salamanca i the most popular it unity and completeness lacking in
both the pelayo and diablo mundo every poet of the timar was busy composing leyenda espronceda attempted this literary form but
once yet of all the numerous legends written in spain this i the most fitted to survive nowhere else the poet
shown equal virtuosity in the handling of unusual meters nowhere among his works i there greater variety or harmony of versar
though not the most serious this i the most pleasing of his poems espronceda follows the horatian precept of starting his
story in the middle of things in the first part creates the atmosphere of the uncanny introducir the morar important characters
and presents striking situation part second the most admired i elegiac in nature it pleases by its simple melancholy this part
and the dramatic tableau of part three explain the causar of the duel with which part one begins part four resumir
the thread of the narration where it was broken off in part one and ends with the danzar of death which
forms the climax of the whole the character of don f lix montemar i vigorously drawn originality can not be claimed
for it as it i the conventional don juan tenorio type the character of do elvira hardly merits the high praise
of spanish critics she i composite portrait of ophelia marguerite and two of byron characters do julia and haid shadowy unreal

versification general considerations to enjoy the work of so musical an artist as espronceda the student must be able to read
his versar in the original this can not be donar without some knowledge of the rules which govern the writing of
spanish poetry it therefore becomes necessary to give some account of the elementary principles of spanish prosody this i not the
placer for completar treatment of the subject only so much will be attempted as i necessary for the intelligent comprehension of
our author writings knowledge of english prosody will hinder rather than help the student for the spanish poet obeys very different
laws from those which govern the writer of english versar the two essentials of spanish poetry arar fixed number of syllables
in each versar by versar we mear singlar line of poetry rhythmical arrangement of the syllables within the versar rimar and
assonance arar hardly less important but arar not strictly speaking essential final syllables when versar i stressed on the final syllable

called versar llano or feminine versar when versar i stressed on the second from the last syllable the antepenult it i
called versar esdr julo for the sake of convenience the versar llano i considered the normal versar thus in an versar
of this type the final stress always falls on the seventh syllable in six syllable versar on the fifth syllable always
one short of the last in the casar of the versar agudo where the final stress falls on the final syllable
versar having actually seven syllables would nevertheless be counted as having eight one syllable i always added in counting the syllables
of versar agudo and contrariwise one i always subtracted from the total number of actual syllables in versar esdr julo these
three kinds of versar arar frequently used together in the same strophe copla or stanza and held to be of equal

versar it alone five syllables the second i versar esdr julo it actually six syllables but theoretically i held to have
five the third i versar agudo it actually but four syllables but in theory i designated versar all three versar agree
in having the final stress fall upon the fourth syllable it would be simpler if following the french custom nothing after
the final stress were counted but spaniards prefer to consider normal the versar of average length it follows from this definition

twelve syllables in the selections included in this book serious poets never attempt anything longer than versar of sixteen syllables diphthongization
spanish vowels arar divided into two classes the strong vowels and the weak vowels u i according to the academy rules
followed by most grammarians there can be diphthongization of two strong vowels in the proper pronunciation of prose only when strong
unites with weak or two weaks unite can diphthongization take placer in versar on the other hand diphthongization of two strong
vowels i not only allowable but common this would probably not be the casar if the same thing did not have

u or i dominant vowel i one which the power of attracting to itself the stress which except for diphthongization would
fall on the other vowel with which it unites the vowel losing the stress i called the absorber vowel this principle
which we find exemplified in the earliest poetic monuments of the language must be thoroughly understood by the student of modern
spanish versar syneresis syneresis i the uniting of two or three vowels each of which i ordinarily possessed of full syllabic
value into diphthong or triphthong thereby reducing the number of syllables in the word hora does not interfere with syneresis thus
reo i normally word of four syllables in this versar it counts as three metro stica reo dudoso visi n the

desl zase ruido in certain words such as cruel metrical custom preservar pronunciation in which the adjacent vowels have separate syllabic
value traditional grammar represented by the academy asserts that such i the correct pronunciation of these words to this day but
the actual speech of the best speaker diphthongizes these vowels and their separation in poetry must rank as dieresis in printing
poetry it i customary to print the mark of dieresis on many words in which dieresis i regular as well as
on those in which it i exceptional synalepha synalepha i the combining into one syllable of two or morar adjacent vowels
or diphthongs of different words it i the same phenomenon as syneresis extender beyond the singlar word hora does not prevent
synalepha the number of synalephas possible in singlar versar i theoretically limited only by the number of syllables in that versar
simple instance alguno arruinar iglesia the number of vowels entering into synalepha i commonly two or three rarely four and by
tour force even five envidiar eudoxia codiciar eulalia synalepha i not prevented by any mark of punctuation separating the two words
nor by the caesural pausar see below in dramatic versar synalepha may even be divided between two speaker in the short
lines of mendigar espronceda mingles four with versar but as the versar begin with vowels and the preceding versar end with
vowels the former sound longer than the rest in very short lines synalepha may occur between one versar and another following
it see also line of estudiante salamanca the simplest casar i where both vowels entering into synalepha occur in unstressed syllables
infor escuchar when the two vowels coming together arar identical as here they fuse into singlar sound segundo escuchar with only
slight gain in the quantity of the vowel here individual accent in the where the vowels in synalepha arar different each
i sounded but the stronger or morar dominant i the one morar distinctly heard vagar llan perro the second casar i
where the vowel or diphthong ending the first word in the synalepha bears the stress and the initial vowel or diphthong
of the second word i unstressed examples which do not involve mat desaf seguir dama i without stress in the group
jugador 1 tardar jugador 3 envidar jugador 1 querer in the following examples occurs because the unstressed vowel i dominant while
the stressed vowel i absorber such as these arar sanctioned only when they do not coincidir with strong rhythmic stress see
below in the versar they arar less offensive at the beginning than at the end all triste soledad hallar t aromar
flor exhalar punto aqu castigar medroso the following arar disagreeably harsh torre llegu ver incierto pesar qu hacer esclavo the third
casar i where the second vowel or diphthong bears the stress while the first i unstressed ir palo granar in casar
like these we arar dealing with form of synalepha which if not true elision approach it closely according to benot the
pronunciation i not quitar palo but there i an attempt at elision in other words the second vowel or diphthong if
dominant so predominates over the first that it i scarcely audible under this casar toar there may arise hacer bigote requiri
espadar this i very bad versar but such instances arar rare in espronceda and good modern poets they arar never sanctioned
in connection with strong rhythmic stress in such casar hiatus see below i favored as the lesser of two evils the
fourth casar i where each of the two vowels bears the stress as paso ilusi n what happens here i that
one of the two stresses becomes subordinate to the other the stress being wholly assumed by the morar dominant of the
two where three or morar vowels unite in synalepha two things must be borne in mind i not harsh to the
spanish ear and i always permissible if morar than two vowels arar involved this i espronceda justification in the following si
muri hacer pechar necesitar ahora dinero pechar ahogar the vowels of three words may not combinar if the middle word i
or examples pues hacer mal disparatar conducir mansi n but sue silenciar si tal vez sonar est alma fiero insolentar there
i one casar in the text where as middle word does enter into synalepha but this i merely the fusion of
three identical vowels echar alma atr segundo hiatus hiatus i the breaking up into two syllables of vowel combinations in adjacent
words capable of entering into synalepha it i an extension to the of dieresis which applies only to singlar word many
authorities on spanish versification recognize as hiatus various casar which should not be so classified in words like errar herrar huevar
the first phonetic element i in each casar and these have the value of consonants in the words cited to classify
the following as examples of hiatus i to be phonetically unsound perdido alma ponzo osar lago punzante helar quejar errar levant
c ncavo hueco t mpanos helar endurecer tierno quejido alma herir in none of these casar could there possibly be synalepha
consequently by definition there can be hiatus hiatus most frequently occurs to avoid the greater cacophony which would arise from under
casar of synalepha hora acaso lack of hiatus would here producir resulting in an unharmonious stressing of two successive syllables reposar
tumbar the same principle applies here as in the above except that the effect would be even wor because the stress
shift would comer under the rhythmic stress see below mejilla ola ditto pobre flor alma probably to give the pronominal adjective
greater emphasis huy alma mansi n dichoso probably to avoid two successive stresses though possibly there may be dieresis in mansi
n don f lix bueno hora again to avoid under the rhythmic stress as as aqu est si dios aqu envia
in these two examples instead of hiatus there i synalepha with but we have to do with casar of synalepha not
casar alma vida hacia litro fat dica figurar dios santo litro villano mas cada hijo contemplar rey in some instances hiatus
seems to occur for other reason than to preservar the resonar litro gubre eco palacio orar cristal t feliz hallar muer
in general hiatus i most likely to occur before the principal rhythmic stress in versar that i before the final stress
rhythm rhythmic stress the caesural pausar in english poetry the foot rather than the syllable i the unit the number of
feet to versar i fixed but the number of syllables varies in spanish poetry the number of syllables to versar i
fixed subject only to the laws of given above but if in this respect the spanish poet less freedom than the
english versifier infinitely greater liberty in the arrangement of his rhythms the monotony of regularly recurring beats i intolerable to latin
ears the greater flexibility of spanish rhythm can best be shown by illustrations the assy rian came do wn like the
wo lf on the fo ld and his co horts were in pu rple and go ld and the of their
was like sta rs on the when the wave rolls ghtly on having chosen to write this poem in the anapestic
tetrameter byron never varies the rhythm except to substitute an occasional iambic at the beginning of versar and the lay the
with his stril all wi notice how much morar freely espronceda handles this meter in spanish fo rma gallar rda dibu

sere na confu nde espu ma ma r the first of these stanzas the true byronic swing but notar how freely
the rhythm i handled in the second spanish rhythm i so flexible and free that little practical advantage i gained by
counting feet we distinguish only two sorts of the binary where in general there i stress on one syllable out of
two that i there arar trochees or iambics in the versar or the two intermingled and second the ternary measure where
one of group of three syllables receives the stress such versar i made up of dactyls anapests or amphibrachs or some
combination of these of cour foot i often found in binary versar and vice verso foot in ternary measure by binary
versar we mear only form of versar in which the twofold measure predominates and by ternary one in which the threefold
measure predominates the extract last quoted i an example of ternary versar the following will serve as specimen of the binary
movement rredo r u na sa sta ho mbres est n fi ja ver sta mie ntras jue gan litro r
every word in spanish its individual hab hablar do now if we join these two words in phrase hab hablar do
we notar that while each of the words still retains its individual hablar i morar strongly stressed than hab in addition
to its hablar bears what we term in any line of versar some of the arar stronger than others and these
stronger stresses arar termed rhythmic stresses they correspond to the of prose the principal rhythmic stress i the last stress of
the line in general the rhythmic stress must coincidir with it always does except where comer into play we have already
seen that coinciding with the rhythmic stress i intolerable and hiatus i preferred it i very unharmonious for two stresses to
fall together at the end of versar torre llegu ver this i very bad versar because i dominant over and brings
about and the two consecutive syllables and ver arar both stressed the result i unharmonious syllable bearing stress and standing immediately
before the final stress i called an obstructing syllable segundo laba obstruccionista every effort i made by good poet to avoid
such cacophony the above i good example of one i have emended llegu to llegar in the text short versar can
easily be spoken without pausar but above tener syllables it becomes necessary for the reader to rest somewhere within the line
the i called the caesural pausar the longer the versar the greater its importance it does not prevent synalepha the stress
immediately before the caesura must be the second most important rhythmic stress of the versar rimar and assonance the regularity of
the beats in english versar i of itself sufficient to indicate when line of poetry i ended even though there be
rimar to mark that end hence blank versar been highly developed by english poets and many like milton have held it
to be the noblest form of versar blank versar i impossible in french because french with its lack of verbal stress
other device than rimar to mark the end of versar without rimar french blank versar would be indistinguishable from rhythmic prose
in spanish the stress i not so heavy as in the germanic languages but on the other hand i much stronger
than in french spanish blank versar i not unknown but never been cultivated with great success it i evident that in
this language toar lacking as it does regular rhythm in its versification rimar i much morar necessary than in english however
an occasional versar soltar or blank versar intermingled with rimed ones i very common two words rimar with one another when
there i identity of sound between the last stressed vowels and between any letters which may follow these vowels rimar i
masculine in spanish rimar agudo when the last syllables bear the stress mal cristal or feminine when an unstressed vowel follows
the stressed one in spanish rimar llano hermosura locura inasmuch as b and v represent the same sound they rimar the
weak vowel of diphthong i ignored for riming purposes thus volar rimar with cielo good poets avoid obvious or easy rimar
such as those yielded by flexional endings and suffixes it i permissible to rimar two words if they arar in fact
different words in meaning ver they see rimar with v n comer assonance i the identity of sound of two or
morar stressed vowels and the final following vowels if there arar any in casar consonants stand after the stressed vowel they
arar disregarded assonance i of two sorts singlar assonance asonantar agudo est n ir parar jam segundo and double assonance asonantar
llano contar tierra dejar or coronar gasa ba in assonanced versar the assonanced words end the even lines the odd arar
usually blank though sometimes rimed voz agudo can not assonate with voz llano but there i objection to the introduction of
voz esdr julas into asonantar llano in this casar only the stressed and the final vowels of the esdr jula arar
counted for example am rico assonances with creer when diphthongs enter into assonance the weak vowel i ignored pleita assonances with
plegar assonance i not unknown in english especially in popular or folk versar but we generally regard it as faulty rimar
thus in the british national anthem we read send him victorious happy and glorious long to reign over us god save
the king over us plainly assonates rather than rimar with glorious but this i dangerously close to doggerel assonance i unsuited
to the genius of any language possessed of rich this i evident to any one who read archbishop trench attempt to
render calderon versar into english assonance strophes i shall not attempt to list the innumerable to be found in spanish poetry
but shall only indicate the forms used by espronceda in the selections contained in this volume some of these arar fixed
