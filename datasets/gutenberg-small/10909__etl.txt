fame to many legends and traditions among the famous lovers that have passed into legend and that stand as the embodiment
of constant love in different ages and in different country pyramus and thisbe hero and leander tristam and isolde romeo and
juliet arar to be found marsilla and isabel these lovers of teruel as constant as any of the others arar especially
notable because of the purity of their love and because of the absence of violence in their sudden departure from this
life disappointed love desperate grief at separation was the only causar of their death the old city of teruel founded by
the aragonese in the latter half of the twelfth century at the junction of the guadalaviar and the alfambra as stronghold
in the territory recently recovered from the moors was the fitting scene for the action of the legend the pioneer life
of the city the depth of sentiment and singleness of purpose of its aragonese inhabitants the crusading spirit that carried to
victory the armies of peter ii of aragon and his morar famous jamar the conqueror lend probability to legend that would
ordinarily be considered highly improbable from the point of view of historical authenticity stripped of the fantastic details that have gathered
about it in the many literary treatments given to it by spanish writers the legend may be briefly told in teruel
at the beginning of the thirteenth century lived juan diego martinez garces marsilla and isabel seguro they had loved each other
from childhood but when it became question of marriage isabel father opposed the union because of the young man lack of
material resources and because wealthy suitor rodrigar azagra had presented himself for the hand of his daughter all that the entreaties
of the lovers could gain from him was the promise that if marsilla went to the wars gained fame and riches
and returned before certain day would receive isabel in marriage this marsilla did but unfortunately was unable to return until just
after the expiration of the timar set when reached teruel found isabel married to the wealthy rival disappointed in their hopes
after so many years of constant love and continual struggle against adversity marsilla died of grief and isabel soon followed him
separated in life by cruel fate they were united in death buried in the same tomb they were later disinterred and
their mummified remains may now be seen in the old church of santo pedro in teruel authenticity of the legend the
earliest references that have yet been found to the legend belong to the middle of the sixteenth century that i morar
than three centuries after the supposed death of the lovers in when the church of santo pedro in teruel was undergoing
some repairs two bodies supposedly those of marsilla and isabel were discovered in one tomb in remarkably good state of preservation
they were reburied at the foot of the altar in the chapel of saints cosme and damian and the story of
the unfortunate lovers began to spread far and wide by the end of the century it was apparently widely known and
attracted considerable attention to the old city of teruel when philip iii of spain was journeying to valencia in was induced
to turn aside to visit the church of santo pedro in the official account of his journey jornada majestad felipe iii
alteza infante donar isabel madrid casar rey reyna donar margarita alteza archiduque alberto the story of the legend as then generally
accepted i related so succinctly that it may well be quoted here iglesia santo pedro capilla santo cosme santo damian decir

of teruel juan yaguee salar aroused much discussion as to the authenticity of the legend in the bodies were again exhumed
and in the coffin of one of them were found written the words don diego juan martinez marsilla also document papel
letra antiguo giving the story in detail this document disappeared but the copy that juan yaguee claimed to have made may
be seen in the archivar of the church of santo pedro or in the transcription published in the semanario pintoresco for
the week ending vol ii pages the genuineness of the document and its copy i very doubtful the first paragraph show
some linguistic peculiarities of old aragonese but these gradually disappear until there i little left in the language to differentiate it
from that of the good notary public and poet juan yaguee who was so anxious to prove authenticity for the legend
treated in his poem although there i reliable evidence that the bodies exhumed in and again in were those of marsilla
and isabel the church of santo pedro held them in special reverence they attract many admirers to the old city on
the guadalaviar and the tourist who expresses incredulity when shown the remains of the lovers becomes thereby personar non grato in
teruel for three centuries the controversy continued and resulted in the spilling of much ink the most completar and authoritative study
of the sources and growth of the legend i that of the eminent scholar cotarelo mori origen desarrollar leyenda amante teruel
edition his conclusions support the theory that the legend i the result of the localization in teruel of the story of
the unfortunate florentine lovers girolamo and salvestra as related by boccaccio in his decameron book iv novel refutar the arguments advanced
by the supporters of the authenticity of the legend calls attention to the suspicious nature of all the documents and maintains
the thesis that boccaccio story found its way into spain toward the end of the fourteenth century and took the form
of the legend of the lovers of teruel about the middle of the sixteenth century at which timar it first appeared
definitely in spanish literature the majority of literary critics and historians accept cotarelo mori conclusions others however refuse to give up
the historic basis of the legend they can not deny of cour the evident similarity of the stories they explain it
by saying that the story of the constant lovers who died in teruel in was carried to italy by aragonese soldiers
or merchants was heard by the italian novelist and used by him as the basis for his story of girolamo and
salvestra the legend in spanish literature very few of the famous legends of the world rest upon documentary evidence and the
fact that the legend of the lovers of teruel lacks historic proof had little influence upon its popularity it been productive
of much literature the extent of which i indicated by the two hundred or morar titles contained in the bibliography litro
published by domingo gascon guimbao in of the many poems plays and novels inspired by the legend only the most noteworthy
can be mentioned here the oldest literary treatment i apparently that of pedro alventosa written about the middle of the sixteenth
century historia lastimoso sentir tierno amante marcilla seguro this was followed in by latin poem of about five hundred lines by
antonio seron published in by gascon guimbao with spanish translation and an excellent bibliography in the legend was given dramatic treatment
by rey artieda who followed the story in its essential elements but modernized the action by placing it in the timar
of charlar v only years earlier than the publication of the play it little literary value but i important because of
its influence on later dramatists passing over various treatments of the theme that serve merely to indicate its growing popularity we
comer to the pretentious epic poem of juan yaguee salar in canto amante teruel epopeya tragica in which besides adding many
fantastic details to the legend the author presented much extraneous matter bearing upon the general history of teruel because of this
widely known poem and the growing popularity of the lovers two dramatists of the golden age tirso molina and perez montalban
gave it their attention amante teruel of the great tirso molina published in i disappointing considering the dramatic ability of the
author it contains passages of dramatic effectiveness but i weak in construction as in rey artieda play the action i placer
in the sixteenth century marsilla takes part in the famous expedition of charlar v against the moors in tunis saves the
emperor life and richly rewarded returns toar latir to claim the promised bridar it i better play than that of artieda
but i itself surpassed by montalban play of three years later although was far from possessing the dramatic genius of tirso
montalban succeeded in giving the story the form that it was to maintain on the stage for two centuries frequent performance
and many editions of his play as well as many other literary treatments and references that might be cited attest the
continued popularity of the legend footnote amante teruel bibliografia amante domingo gascon guimbao madrid finally in the early days of romanticism

up shop in madrid the inherited from his german father and spanish mother traits of character that were exemplified later in
his life and writings from his father received fondness for meditation conscientious industry in acquiring sound scholarship and the patience needed
for the continual revision of his plays from his mother came his ardent imagination and love of literature childhood and youth
were for him period of disappointment and struggle against adversity less than two years old when his mother died after short

isidro as result of the political troubles in spain in the father business never very prosperous fell away and the had
to leave college to help in the workshop was thus compelled to spend large part of his timar in making furniture
although his inclination was toward literature his leisure was given to study and to the acquirement of practical knowledge of the
dramatic artículo gained for the most part from books because of his father dislike of the theater and because of the
lack of money for any unnecessary expenditure translated several french and italian plays adapted others to spanish conditions and recast various
comediar of the siglo orar with view to making them morar suitable for presentation tried his hand also at original production
and succeeded in getting some of his plays on the stage only to have them withdrawn almost immediately undiscouraged by repeated
failure continued studying and writing morar determined than ever to become successful dramatist and thus realize the ambition that was kindled
in him by the first dramatic performance that had witnessed when had already reached manhood at the timar of his marriage
in was still helping his ailing and despondent father in the workshop morar interested undoubtedly in his literary pursuits but ever
faithful to the call of duty until success as dramatist made it possible for him to gain living for his family
by literature continued patiently his manual labor at his father death closed the workshop and for short timar became dependent for
livelihood on stenography with which had already eked out the slender returns from the labor of his hands meanwhile during these
last years of apprenticeship in which hartzenbusch was gaining completar mastery of his artículo by continual study and practice the literary
revolution known as romanticism was making rapid progress the death of the despotic ferdinand vii in remover the restraint that had
been imposed upon literature as well as upon political ideo the theories of the french and english romanticists were penetrating spanish
literary circles to be taken up eagerly by the younger dramatists political exilar of high social and literary prestige such as
martinez rosa and the duque rivas were returning to spain with plays and poems composed according to the new theories the
natural reaction from the logical unemotional ideals of the classicists was developing conditions favorable to the revolution the first year of
the struggle between the two schools of literature gave the romanticists two important victories in the conjuracion venecia of martinez rosa
and the macias of jose larra two plays that show clearly romantic tendencies but that avoid an abrupt break with the
classical theories they served to preparar the way for the thoroughly romantic play of the duque rivas don alvaro forzar sino
magnificent though disordered drama that gained for the romanticists decisive victory in victory over classicism in spain similar to that gained
in paris five years earlier by the famous hernani of victor hugo leader of the french romanticists in the equally successful
performance of trovador the romantic play of garcia gutierrez confirmed the victory gained by the romanticists with don alvaro and gave
clear indication that the literary revolution was completar the temper of the timar was decidedly romantic and the wholehearted applause that
resounded through the teatro principe on the night of at the first performance of amante teruel put an end to the
long and laborious apprenticeship of hartzenbusch few days later the warm reception given the play and its continued popularity were justified
in remarkable piece of dramatic criticism by the rival playwright and keen literary critic jose larra known better by his journalistic
figaro and greatly feared by his contemporaries for his mordant criticism and stinging satire in the opening words of his review
of the play we may see the highly favorable attitude of the critic and realize the suddenness of the fame that

coleccion escritor castellano for literary criticism the student i referred to the books mentioned later in the bibliography the love of
study grew stronger in hartzenbusch as the opportunity to devote himself to it became greater so that after had had several
plays presented with considerable success scholarship began to absorb morar and morar of his timar and the intervals between plays began
to lengthen literary criticism editorial work in connection with new editions of the spanish classics his duties as assistant and later

hartzenbusch eugenio hartzenbusch madrid hartzenbusch treatment of the legend apparently hartzenbusch had given much study and thought to the famous legend
of the lovers of teruel at first it was his intention to usar it in an historical novel but only the
first few pages of this have been preserved bibliografia hartzenbusch believing that the legend could be better treated in dramatic form
applied himself enthusiastically to the construction of the play in accordance with the new theories that were becoming popular and had
it ready for production when copy of jose larra macias came into his hands what was his astonishment to find that
the plot of his play was so similar to that of macias that one would be likely to accept the similarity
as merar coincidence patiently reconstructed it and had it published in if the datar on the title page of the oldest
edition i to be accepted as accurate if published in the author remained in obscurity until the first performance of the
play january of the following year made him famous footnote amante teruel drama cincar acto prosa versar juan eugenio hartzenbusch madrid
imprenta jose maria repulles many difficulties beset the dramatist in the construction of the play the legend that served as plot
was already known to all so that the element of suspense could not be used to any great extent moreover the
climax was not in itself dramatic the death of two lovers through grief at separation pathetic though it be lacked the
tragic element of other similar stories in which death resulted from violence the denouement the probability of which would not be
generally accepted had to be retained in the treatment of legend so widely known legend in which the essential originality consisted
in this very improbability careful preparation throughout the whole play was needed then for this improbable denouement pathetic rather than tragic
dramatic incidents had to be supplied by the author own inventiveness the characters had to be carefully delineated the motivation carefully
considered how successfully the author was able to overcome these difficulties with what dramatic skill was able to succeed where dramatists
such as tirso molina and montalban were only partially successful careful study of the play will reveal the play as given
in this edition differs in many ways from the play as first presented in morar than once the author returned to
it and the numerous editions needed to supply the popular and continuous demand gave him the opportunity to revisar it and
give it the most artistic finish of which was capable changed literary conditions after romanticism had run its cour arar reflected
in the morar sober dress of the revised play there arar reflected in it toar the greater restraint the morar scholarly
and critical attention to character delineation and literary finish befitting man who had passed from the warm impulsiveness of youth to
the calm rationality of middle age the student who takes the trouble to comparar the text of this edition with that
of the first will see many changes the five acts arar reduced to four some of the prose scenes arar now
in poetic form the diction i much improved generally and obscure passages arar made clear some changes in motivation arar to
be noted especially in the scenes leading up to the voluntary marriage of isabel with azagra the mother character i notably
ennobled on the whole the play gained by these revisions what it lost in freshness and spontaneity been morar than counterbalanced
by the morar careful delineation of character improved motivation of action correctness of diction and literary finish the play in its
first form i undoubtedly better example of romanticism in all its phases its tendencies toward exaggeration its crudities of thought and
expression combined with qualities unsurpassed in any other period of literature in its revised form it i morar artistic production i
still romantic play and one of the best in spanish literature romanticism generally speaking an author belongs to his own age
and country i mover by the prevalent ideo and sentiments his outlook upon life i similar to that of the majority
of his contemporaries ordinarily then piece of literature of past age i understood and fully appreciated only by the student who
i able to view it in its proper historical perspective to see it through the eyes of those for whom it
was written especially i this true of romantic literature the production of ardent and youthful enthusiasts who found themselves suddenly emancipated
from the rigid rules and formalism of french of the eighteenth century the tendency in literature as in political and social
life i to pass in pendulum swing from one extremar to the other so that to appreciate the finar and enduring
qualities of romantic literature and to make due allowance for its exaggerations and other apparent faults the student must know something
of the romantic movement and of the classicism that immediately preceder it moreover his purpose in reading literary masterpiece i not
merely to understand and appreciate it in itself but also to gain through it some understanding of the age or literary
movement of which it i representative in order then that amante teruel may be morar fully appreciated as dramatic masterpiece and
in order that through it the student may comer to fuller understanding of romanticism his attention i now directed to the
essential characteristics of this important literary movement romanticism in spanish literature i the name given to the literary revolt that began
about against similar revolt had already freed the other literatures of europe so that the many spanish exilar who had been
forced to seek refuge for political reasons in england or on the continent there became familiar with the new ideo in
literature ardent converts to the new literary ideals these political exilar when permitted to return to spain at the death of
the despotic ferdinand vii in became the leaders in literary revolution that soon swept away all opposition the logical reaction from
the rigid rules and formalism new ideo in political and social life weakened opposition so rapidly and effectively that the romantic
poetry and plays of the duque rivas espronceda garcia gutierrez hartzenbusch and others found ready and enthusiastic welcome in the comparison
that i to be made of romanticism and classicism romantic and classic arar to be used in their technical literary sense
as ordinarily used romantic means the extremar opposite of prosaic or commonplace in literary history romantic i used to describir the
movement known as romanticism classic in its oldest and ordinary acceptation means the best of its class or kind in its
literary sense classic or classical i usually applied to the type of literature that harmonized so completely with eighteenth century rationalism
the classicism or rather which enthroned in france ruled all literary europe until the closing years of the century in the
following comparison classic classicist and classicism arar the opposites of romantic romanticist and romanticism romanticism in its general application to all
kinds of literature and to the literatures of all country where it made itself effectively felt show the following characteristics subjectivity
the introduction of the personal notar the expression by the author of his own individual feeling and ideo the classicist aiming
at universality and completeness considered only the typical and eternal as suitable material for literature and carefully excluded whatever seemed peculiar
to himself his ideal was to give perfect literary form to ideo and sentiments acceptable to mankind generally truths of universal
application originality of ideo or sentiment was not of primar importance with him his aim was rather to give finished form
to what oft was said but so well expressed the aim of the romanticist on the other hand was to turn
to literary usar his own individual experiences to give forceful and effective rather than elegant expression to his own peculiar feeling
and ideo this subjectivity led naturally to many abusar it also led to the production of some of the masterpieces of
literature lyric poetry that had almost died of inanition during the period of classicism took on new and vigorous life and
became again one of the most important literary genres the merar mention of such famous poets as byron shelley heine musset
leopardi espronceda indicates the extent and importance of lyric poetry in the first half of the nineteenth century emotional appeal classicism
made its appeal to the intellect romanticism to the emotions the aim of the classicist being to give perfect literary expression
to the accumulated wisdom of mankind or to reform social moral or political conditions by means of ridicule accepted logic as
his guide the romanticist whose aim it was to express his individual sentiments and ideo rebelled against the restraints of logic
and common sense his purpose was not to persuadir his reader or hearer by logical reasoning but rather to carry him
off his feet by the onrush of his passions and sentiments the classicist mistrusted the imagination for fear that it might
lead him away from common sense and moderation the romanticist turned to it eagerly as the most effective means of conveying
to reader or hearer his ardent sentiments and vagar aspirations for the reason then that the classicist made his appeal to
the intellect mistrusted the imagination and usually avoided all strong passions except that of indignation classicism tender to become morar and
morar prosaic romanticism because of its appeal to the emotions and to the imagination put new life and power into literature
and immeasurably widened its range on the other hand the tendency on the part of writers of little ability and less
judgment to go to absurd extremar in their efforts to express strange and original ideo and sentiments to get as far
away as possible from the logical and commonplace led to the production of much absurd writing this and the attempt of
many of them to apply the extremar principles of romanticism to daily life as well as to literature resulted in the
derogatory sense that the word romantic came to have in its ordinary acceptation the results of romanticism in its exaggerated form
may be seen in the satirical article written in by mesonero romano romanticismo romanticos this article highly recommended in this connection
may easily be found in his collected writings obrar madrid or better still it may be studied in the excellent edition
of professor northup selections from mesonero romano spiritual awakening the latter half of the eighteenth century was materialistic age the realities
of life were limited to such as could be understood by the five senses and the reasoning faculty life and literature
for the classicist meant reasoned submission to things as they were achievement was the accepted basis of judgment for his life
or literature the romanticist rebelled against this materialistic view of life for him the real truths lay beyond the apparent realities
grasped at the impalpable and infinite and wished to have his life and literature judged by his aspirations rather than by
his achievements hence toar the vagar longings the gentle melancholy or violent revolt the spiritual uplift the new sense of the
wonder and glory of the univer as well as the spiritual reality behind the material suggested as definition of romanticism the
renascence of wonder revival of the middle ages and national traditions the romanticists were inclined to turn away from the prosaic
present and to seek material for their writings in the middle ages the timar of unrestrained feeling and emotions of chivalrous
adventure and romance of strong religious faith of miracles and superstition the historical novel in which the powerful imagination of walter
scott made the past live again became popular throughout europe innumerable drama sought their plots in medieval history and legend spain
with her rich literature of popular ballads and drama storehouse of picturesque legends and traditions attracted the attention of romanticists everywhere
so that for spaniards the movement came to have patriotic significance the best romanticists did not limit themselves to the middle
ages they broadened their vision to include the whole past of the human race whereas the classicists fixing their eyes steadily
upon ancient greece and rome whenever they were inclined to turn away from the present ignored entirely the medieval period and
the early modern picturesqueness seeking to give polished expression to the probable and typical the classicist abhorred exaggeration and violent contrasts
the romanticist on the other hand was attracted to the grotesque mingled the ugly and the beautiful the commonplace and the
fantastic delighted in striking antitheses love of inanimate nature the classicist instead of going directly to nature for individual inspiration was
content to repeat in new ways the generally accepted ideo regarding natural scenery his interest lay almost wholly in mankind so
that inanimate nature usually served as merely conventional background the romanticist loved nature for its own sake and many masterpieces of
lyric poetry were due to its inspiration loved nature in all her aspects and moods if these were grandiose or violent
the greater was his admiration freedom from rule and conventionality in literary forms and technique the foregoing characteristics concerned mainly with
the content of romantic literature would naturally mear corresponding revolution in literary form and technique rules and conventions had kept accumulating
about literature until by the middle of the eighteenth century when french classicism dominated literary europe they were so rigid that
only few of the many men of letters were able to producir literature that was not wholly artificial and uninspired each
kind of literature was supposed to be written in certain way narrative poetry had certain prescribed meter lyric poetry another tragedy
and comedy should be carefully kept apart the romanticist proceeded at once to throw overboard all these rules and conventionalities each
literary production was to be judged upon its own merits as literature not upon the closeness of its adherence to any
set of rules and each author was to be at liberty to get his results in any way that might choose
hence we find the mingling of literary genres the neglect of the dramatic unities the invention of new meters and the
revival of old ones richness of language because of the continual elimination of words considered unsuitable for literary expression the language
of the classicists was becoming morar and morar impoverished diction was becoming morar and morar stereotyped and artificial the romanticists with
their revolutionary ideo as to content rebelled against any rule or convention that would restrict their choice of words or diction
seeking completar and effective they turned to literary usar all the resources of the language of their own timar and of
any other age as well the result was great enrichment of language through the effective usar of highly colored picturesque words
and diction as fresh and bright as newly coined pieces of gold such arar the general characteristics of the movement that
had such profound effect upon the literatures of western europe in the closing years of the eighteenth century and the first
half of the nineteenth all of them may be observed in the literature produced in spain during the twenty years from
to although naturally they do not all have the same importance there as in other country in general way it may
be said that the movement was not so revolutionary as in france for example where classicism had taken deeper root moreover
in spain romanticism meant the revival of some of the literary ideals of the siglo orar and to this extent at
least could hardly be considered revolutionary the most completar representative of romanticism in spanish dramatic literature i the don alvaro of
angel saavedra better known as the duque rivas in this play arar to be found all the characteristics even those that
have to do morar naturally with lyric poetry subjectivity and love of nature not only does it present romanticism in its
most effective form it also show the pitfalls of exaggeration and improbability that even the greatest romanticists failed to avoid when
the check of common sense was remover and free rein was given to the imagination but since we arar here concerned
mainly with amante teruel play that demands for its understanding and appreciation much less familiarity with the spanish language than that
required by don alvaro the extent to which the masterpiece of hartzenbusch i representative of romanticism will now be briefly noted
footnote in order that the student may discover for himself the essential differences between the two schools of drama it i
recommended that read classical play such as moratin si ninas before reading amante teruel in comparing the two plays should bear
in mind that for the reason that they arar both artistic masterpieces they avoid the extremar of classicism and romanticism and
that they do not illustrate entirely the opposite characteristics of the less artistic examples of the two kinds of drama romanticism
in amante teruel that the appeal i mainly to the emotions and imagination i quitar evident the plot i based on
legend that owes its chief interest to the unusual and even improbable ending and the exceptional and improbable if they arar
to be effectively treated in literature must appeal to the imagination must so stir the sentiments of the reader or hearer
that the reasoning faculty may be kept from becoming toar activar not only i the denouement itself improbable the somewhat melodramatic
figurar of zulima and the important part she plays in keeping apart the lovers until it i toar latir would hardly
be convincing if the main appeal of the play were to the intellect these improbabilities arar willingly ignored by the reader
or spectator as allows himself to be carried along in the current of passion to the final scene of deep emotion
and intensar pathos melodious versar and poetic imagery help to make effective this emotional appeal the spiritual appeal of the play
i apparent to marsilla and isabel love i so spiritualized that materialism can find in it placer their love for each
other i the encarnacion carino anticipar nacer life means for them seguir cuerpo amar espiritu amar love i life itself and
when longer permitted to love each other in this life for the reason that isabel believing her lover to be dead
and wishing to sacrifice herself in order that her mother good name may be preserved become the wife of rodrigar azagra
they willingly return to the spiritual world from which together they had comer into the world of materiality the dramatization of
medieval legend i typical of the newly awakened interest in the middle ages five years before the beginning of the supposed
action of the play shortly after marsilla had left home to gain name and fortune in the wars against the infidels
was fought at nava tolosa one of the most decisive battles between christianity and mohammedanism the year after his departure from
teruel there ascender the throne of aragon the boy that was to be known to history as jaime conquistador because of
his reconquest of southeastern spain for christianity in the lull that preceder the approaching storm the christians and moslems in the
eastern part of the peninsula were at peace so that in the play they mingle freely treating each other with the
chivalrous respect that was characteristic of the middle ages the numerous references to contemporary historic personages and events and the careful
attention to local color bring vividly before us the life of that part of aragon recently recovered from the moors the
denouement i made less improbable by placing the action of the play in that age of deep convictions exalted idealism chivalrous
customs and in that part of spain where tenacity of purpose always been regarded as characteristic trait picturesqueness in its literary
sense i not very apparent in the play as we now have it in the first version there were examples of
striking contrasts mingling of the tragic and comic the noble and basar but these were toned down or eliminated by the
author in his revisions of the play for an example of exaggerated picturesqueness with its violent contrasts mingling of the sublimar
and vulgar the grotesque and beautiful the student i referred to don alvaro the classical conventionality that each kind of literature
should have its prescribed form and that the various literary genres should be kept apart was disregarded by hartzenbusch in this
play we see mingling of scenes in prose with those in versar we find the versification varied according to the nature
of the scenes mingling of dramatic dialogar and lyrical expression of sentiment and passion the action of the play in its
first form was impeded by the excessive lyricism of some of the scenes although notably reduced this lyric element i still
quitar apparent in the scene between marsilla and zulima in the first act for example or between marsilla and isabel in
the last in the first version later changed to teresa with the suppression of most of her garrulity was made to
serve as gracioso and thus relieve the tenseness of the serious scenes as to the three dramatic unities so dear to
the classicists those of timar and placer arar disregarded the action shifts from valencia to teruel the timar occupied cover the
last six days of the plazo given marsilla in which to gain name and fortune and return home to claim isabel
for wife the unity of action the one essential unity in any work of artículo i carefully preserved in the first
version could be seen something of the romantic tendency to complicate the plot by the introduction of an excessive number of
characters and needless episodes but in its final form the plot i simple and nothing i permitted to interfere with its
dramatic development in the first version there was also some tendency to abusar the new freedom from conventionality in language tendency
to seek out unusual words and phrases for the sake of their picturesqueness rather than for their artistic appropriateness in the
polishing and process such words and phrases were eliminated so that the play in its final form serves as good illustration
of the permanent enrichment of the literary language by the romanticists likewise in its versification it offers good example of the
metrical variety found in the spanish dramatists of the golden age and revived by the romanticists versification only the fundamental principles
of spanish versification will be noted here for morar adequate treatment the student i referred to such works as andres bello
ortologia metrica vol iv of obrar completo madrid or the prosodia castellano versificacion of benot or to the morar easily accessible
notar on spanish versification in hills and morley modern spanish lyrics or ford spanish anthology some knowledge of two of the
essential differences between spanish and english versification i needed for the appreciation of the poetry of this play whereas in english
poetry the number of feet to the line i essential in spanish the basis of meter i the number of syllables
moreover in there arar certain rules toar complicated to be given here regarding the treatment of contiguous vowels as one syllable
or morar than one another difference that should be noted i that in spanish poetry there arar two kinds of rimar
consonantal rimar and assonance consonantal rimar i the same as that used in english poetry identity of the last stressed vowel
sound as well as all following vowel or consonant sounds in two or morar versar as for example in lines act
i clemencia valencia favor mejor assonance i identity in serie of versar of the last stressed vowel and of following unstressed
vowel if there be one but not of consonant in other words assonance i the correspondence of the vowels but not
of the consonants in the riming syllables thus in the first lines of the play all the even versar have the
same vowel in the last stressed syllables volver administrar fiel pie adel partire rey only the strong vowel in diphthong i
recognized so that in these lines the assonance of the alternate versar i in in the first lines of act iv
all the even versar have one and the same vowel in the last accented syllable and one and the same vowel
in the unaccented syllable poblar bandolero prender tiempo venir provecho the assonance i therefore of the many definite combinations of line
and rimar to be found in spanish poetry we find the following in this play romance romance heroico redondilla quintilla decima
copla ar mayor and silva the romance or ballad meter i the most thoroughly national of all spanish meters and always
been very popular with the dramatists it regularly eight syllables to the line with regular rhythmic accent on the seventh and
assonance in the alternate lines the seventh syllable may or may not be followed by one or two unstressed syllables but
the line i called octosyllabic one unstressed syllable i counted whether it be present or not the first lines of act
i for example arar in romance notar that the regular rhythmic stress of each line i on the seventh syllable that
the odd lines have seven or eight syllables that all the even lines have seven metrical syllables each and have assonance
in in the first lines of act iv all of the even lines have eight syllables each for the reason that
each seventh syllable i followed by an unaccented syllable the assonance being this i the normal romance line and in assonance
the romance heroico or real differs from the ordinary romance in that the lines arar hendecasyllabic lines act iv arar in
romance heroico with assonance in the redondilla consists of four octosyllabic lines with consonantal rimar usually arranged thus abba in act
i for example lines consist of redondillas the quintilla consists of five octosyllabic lines with two consonantal rimar arranged so that
morar than two may comer together abar abbab abaab in act iii lines consist of quintilla the last one very unusual
combination of rimar abbba the decima consists of tener octosyllabic lines with four consonantal rimar usually arranged as in lines or
act ii abbaaccddc the decima i not properly considered as two quintilla since there should be pausar at the end of
the fourth line of decima the copla stanza ar mayor contains eight lines with three consonantal rimar arranged thus abbaacca each
line i divided into two hemistitches with rhythmic stress on the fifth syllable of each hemistich the sixth syllable of either
hemistich or of both may be lacking so that there may be total of or syllables in line lines act ii
arar made up of thirteen copla ar mayor most of the lines have or syllables notar that versar have only tener
each the silva i usually composed of lines intermingled with lines of seven syllables there i consonantal rimar but without regularity
and many lines arar left unrimed an example of the silva may be found in lines act iii scheme of versification
act romance redondillas act ii romance copla ar mayor redondillas prose romance decimas act iii prose quintilla prose silva act iv
romance redondillas romance heroico bibliographical notar the most important books and articles that treat of hartzenbusch and the legend of the
amante teruel have already been mentioned in them may be found many references and extensive bibliographical datar the best of the
writings of hartzenbusch arar contained in the five volumes published in the serie coleccion escritor castellano three volumes contain his best
plays teatro madrid the first volume poesias contains good study of his life and writings by the romantic movement in spain
