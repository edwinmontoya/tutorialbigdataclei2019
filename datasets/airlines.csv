10001,Delta Air Lines,21-Jun-14,Thailand,7,Economy,4,YES,Flew Mar 30 NRT to BKK. All flights were great. Flight was on-time and the in-flight entertainment was great. Apart from the meals - some Thai passengers cannot eat beef so the flight crews tried to ask other passengers who could eat beef and changed the meals around. We feel disappointed with their food services.
10002,Delta Air Lines,19-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Flight 2463 leaving West Palm Beach (PBI) at 2.42pm on June 15 arriving at New York LaGuardia (LGA) at 5.30pm. I was slated to take flight 3997 from LaGuardia to Pittsburgh (PIT) leaving at 6.59pm arriving in Pittsburgh at 8.35pm. Every time I fly Delta I end up getting stuck in whatever airport my layover is for 12+ hours due to cancellations or delays. There is no attempt to accommodate me the customer with a hotel for the night a partial refund or even a blanket or pillow for my extended stay in the airport.
10003,Delta Air Lines,18-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Delta Website froze 4 times trying to set up flight to three different locations. Had to call and set up over the phone only to find out at the curb our flights were changed with no coumarin to us. My pregnant wife and I sat for over an hour (on the curb) for them to correct the error. We flew to our next location to find the same issue with boarding. We sat outside the line for a half hour while they tried to correct before the plane flew off. I spoke to Delta and they said because of the economy they are having issues. This does not explain why they couldn't send us an e-mail showing our flights changed with new boarding passes. The worst flying experience ever. They could care less about you even if you need special attention. Check baggage fees - Delta packs the plane and charges outrageous prices for additional bags.
10004,Delta Air Lines,17-Jun-14,USA,9,Business,4,YES,"I just returned from a round-trip First/Business Elite FLL-ATL-MUC-ATL-FLL trip. I really must say that all the flights were great. Every flight was on-time the flight crews were exceptionally good the in-flight entertainment was good but could be improved the meals were good and tasty. I only wish Delta would update its meal service and add some new items. Going over to MUC the man behind me even commented to the flight attendant ""Is it the usual?"" It is always steak chicken breast pasta (no meat or fish - just pasta) and a cold plate. I've written to DL about adding fish lamb duck etc. to the rotation. (They actually had lamb on the MUC-ATL flight!) Even flight attendants say that every time they have ""fish"" it is the most ordered by passengers. I guess Michelle Bernstein has run out of ideas. That is my only suggestion to improve things in Business Elite: Get more imaginative on the meal offerings! It really isn't that difficult."
10005,Delta Air Lines,17-Jun-14,Ecuador,7,Economy,3,YES,"Round-trip flight from Quito Ecuador to Birmingham Alabama with one stop in Atlanta. The check in process was difficult since we are foreigners trying to leave the country. Nothing against Delta. The delta gate agents went through 3 security procedures before we even lined up to go to the plane. I think it was the airport's rules. I flew a Delta 757-200 to Atlanta on a red-eye flight. We took off around 11.40 pm and we started flying over the Pacific Ocean. There was no personal entertainment on this type of aircraft so we were forced to watch a movie. They started serving ""breakfast"" around 1.20 am. ""Breakfast"" was a cold turkey and mayonnaise sandwich fruit and a brownie. They took they tray away and we did not eat anything else. Around 5.00 am we started our descent into Atlanta. The landing was smooth and we soon de-boarded and headed through immigration to board our next 56 min flight to Birmingham. Atlanta airport is very confusing as to where restaurants and lounges are. We boarded our MD88 to Birmingham. Since it was an hour flight they should have served us something but the didn't. We landed in Birmingham smoothly."
10006,Delta Air Lines,17-Jun-14,USA,9,Business,5,YES,Narita - Bangkok June 13 Business Elite 747. Slight delay due to hold for other delayed inbound flights but all in all an excellent flight. Chief Purser was an experienced friendly (old school) gentleman who worked hard to insure good service. Seat was a comfortable lie flat pod offering more privacy than the first class American 777 I had just connected from. Decent food with even a light second offering before landing. Excellent entertainment options offered. I would certainly do this again.
10007,Delta Air Lines,14-Jun-14,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Flight from NY La Guardia to Cleveland OH at 01.15am email said flight would be delayed by 2 hours. Delayed our taxi to airport by 2 hours. Got to airport to find flight now cancelled but no email communication from Delta no phone call just the pleasure of an extra 1.5 hours at the airport as they had rebooked us onto 3.20 flight. Staff no training in apologising to passengers for inconvenience - staff couldn't give a damn. Although travelling with my husband they couldn't be bothered to sit us together. So was the flight cancelled for bad weather? I don't think so. Too many additional reasons given eg staff not able to fly as on duty too long etc. We then discovered that the earlier flight had been cancelled too. Could this have been about consolidation. Advice don't travel with them if you can avoid them.
10008,Delta Air Lines,14-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Originally I had a 2 hour layover. Delta changed our flights to a 4 hour layover. The plane now has been delayed another 20 minutes so my family of 6 and I are at the airport right now for a 4.5 hour layover. This is not acceptable Delta should do something about this. Fly with an airline that cares. It's surely not Delta!
10009,Delta Air Lines,13-Jun-14,USA,4,Business,2,NO,We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.
10010,Delta Air Lines,13-Jun-14,UK,9,Economy,3,YES,"I flew from Heathrow to Seattle. To be honest I was dreading the flight as I had read some really bad reviews of Delta. But it was excellent. The seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in Economy - with a great selection of films TV shows and music. The food whilst being obviously ""airline food"" was nice enough and lots of it. They listed only one meal - lunch - on the website but they served two more rounds of snacks throughout the flight - an ok sandwich and a really nice calzone. The staff were really friendly as well. Again I was dreading the service as a lot of other reviews mentioned their bad attitude. But the ones on my flight were lovely. Not sure if this is a sign of better things to come from Delta or by the fact that the route is brand new for them but it was a great flight."
10011,Delta Air Lines,11-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,I was a bit stubborn about flying Delta for the first time since I'm a fan of Frontier and I don't fly very often about once every three to four years. I took flight 1531 from MSP to BWI and I was very impressed. We left on time and the crew was friendly. After this experience I am very eager to fly Delta again.
10012,Delta Air Lines,10-Jun-14,Australia,10,Economy,5,YES,JFK-LHR. Had a great on time flight out of JFK with Delta. I found the service friendly and food was great. Constantly coming through the cabin with refreshments certainly not dehydrated at the end of the flight. Only criticism was when we were coming in to land into London the cabin crew did not ask passengers to raise their closed window blinds which made me feel a little unsafe sitting in the middle seats as I couldn't see what was going on outside during landing. The flight attendant told me after it's not US policy to raise the window blinds Delta why not just make it part of your safety policy. Would fly them again.
10013,Delta Air Lines,9-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My wife and I fly frequently and over the last couple of years have found ourselves on Delta a couple of times. Each of the prior trips found delays once missing a connecting flight due directly to the incompetence of Delta personnel. I wrote this off I. The past but today is the final straw. We flew from San Antonio to Atlanta to catch a connecting flight to Milan for a long awaited vacation. As we were boarding the 767 in Atlanta I noticed the port engine nacelle was open. Once we were buckled in the captain announced that maintenance was waiting on a part and it would take up to an hour to depart. An hour goes by and they have the part but they can't get it installed. Another hour goes by. They're still trying to fix it. More excuses more delays. Never again Delta this was strike three!
10014,Delta Air Lines,9-Jun-14,USA,10,Premium,5,YES,DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun. Three more flights on Delta that week were routine but what an experience this one flight was.
10015,Delta Air Lines,6-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Our flight from Fairbanks to Minneapolis was a great flight with great service. On our return flights the service was great. However the flight was very hot. Multiple passengers complained and nothing was done on 2 separate flights. Given a choice I will not fly Delta again I didn't appreciate the two four hour sauna flights. I was dressed in sandals shorts T shirt.
10016,Delta Air Lines,5-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,On May 22 after a 6-hour delay 5 alerts and us waiting with hope at the terminal flight 5030 to Atlanta was canceled. And as per airport security and Delta counter the flight was canceled due to radar failure. This cancellation caused us to miss our connecting flight to Lima Peru. On same day Delta re-booked flight to Atlanta departing from another airport and for a later time. To get to this airport cost us $175.00. However once at the airport we begged to Delta to get us on a flight to Lima Peru instead Delta personnel there and over the phone made a mockery of our request by pretending to help us when in reality they were just wasting our time. In the meantime our newly re-booked flight was delayed for approximate 3 hrs and we arrived to Atlanta at midnight. Next day on 05/23 we finally traveled to Lima Peru but it was too late. We will never consider Delta for future travel.
10017,Delta Air Lines,3-Jun-14,Canada,9,Economy,4,YES,Considering how Delta Airlines was an American Air carrier I initially wasn't expecting much and imagined that service would be mediocre sort of like Air Canada but to my surprise my Delta experience was great! Staff were polite the flights were punctual with my returning flight from MSP-YVR being about 15 minutes late due to a computer that needed replacement. Other than the fact that they should really replace/refurbish those A319s my flight was very pleasant.
10018,Delta Air Lines,2-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,Travelled MSP-LHR AMS-MSP in May 2014. Flights were on time. Flight attendants responsive enough and food was okay. Economy comfort seats provide decent legroom. I travel with Delta quite a bit and rarely have problems. They get you to your destination reliably for a decent price.
10019,Delta Air Lines,29-May-14,USA,7,Business,2,YES,JFK-LAX on a 757-200 in Business on May 17 angled seats with ample leg room excellent service then onward to HNL on a 757-300 in First: seats comparable to Premium Economy as far as the leg room goes poor recline the service was excellent though large screen IFE good food and drinks. May 25 HNL-LAX on an aged 767-200 in First same poor seat recline but good food and service old-style IFE. May 26 LAX-NYC on a 767-300ER Business Elite outstanding newly refurbished cabin flat bed seats outstanding food and service. The only complaint - never - ending turbulence but that was not airline's fault of course. To sum up Delta's First Class is not worth the money I will stick to premium economy instead in the future and the Business Elite is simply outstanding for a Domestic flight.
10020,Delta Air Lines,28-May-14,UK,9,Economy,3,YES,Third long haul flight with Delta LHR-ATL-TPA-ATL-LHR all flights on time first transatlantic flight they run out of food selections so only had pasta left which looked rather unappetising. Good selection of movies and games on the long haul flights seats were comfortable with good legroom. My only gripe is Atlanta airport why do you have to queue to go through security after getting off an international flight to connect with your next plane not Deltas fault but never had to do this before.
10021,Delta Air Lines,26-May-14,UK,2,Economy,3,NO,LHR-JFK (Virgin) then JFK-DTW with Delta Connection (Returned on the same route and carriers 10 days later. Held up at JFK both ways for 12 hours due to weather not Delta's fault but our return connection to LHR was rebooked without our knowledge due to our late departure from DTW. This resulted in a rush to try and make the connection only to be told we were off the flight and rebooked for the following morning. Delta then did not issue us with the correct tickets resulting in a 4am nailbiter with Virgin check in as they tried to figure our what Delta had done. I am trying to plan my next trip to DTW to avoid Delta connections due to this.
10022,Delta Air Lines,24-May-14,USA,7,Economy,3,NO,Travelled to London with my mom JFK-LHR via a Boeing 767-400ER on DL 403 which was an evening flight. Everything went very pleasant from food service to inflight entertainment seat comfort and cabin crew as well as cabin cleanliness. My complain would be our return flight which was rather a Boeing 767-300 aircraft. The Cabin was not clean and very narrow bathrooms have some odor and seats were comfortable even for a seven hour flight. Everything else went ok the crew looked exhausted and smiled less they were friendly and very caring. Also to mention food portions are quite small and selections must be thought carefully. If it was not for their 767-300 plane everything went very well. I prefer better other airlines notably American British Airways and Virgin Atlantic as a better option for economy especially with AA's B777-200ER which was their major upgrade.
10023,Delta Air Lines,20-May-14,USA,4,Economy,2,NO,"Very disappointed with Delta Airlines. I try to plan and budget for everything and was very irritated when I checked two bags for $25 each - Delta Advertises on the back of your ticket ""Your first checked bag is always free"" (within their recommended size and under 50lbs checked their website prior to our trip to avoid charges). I don't care if you charge me for my luggage but seriously don't advertise one thing and say another. If you book your tickets 6 months in advance and you pick your seats on that airplane and the plane is empty when you pick them you should at least be able to sit next to your significant other - but don't bother its a waste of time. Pleased with the flight crew and flight attendants kudos to them for positive attitudes. However I don't think I will be flying with delta anytime soon."
10024,Delta Air Lines,20-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,"Boy are we never going to fly Delta ever again. Our first experience with Delta involved our honeymoon - they overbooked our flight to go to Jackson Hole so they re routed us to a different airport and set us up with a car service to take us to Jackson Hole (this delayed our trip about 5-6 hours and we were driving through Yellowstone Park in pitch black to our cabin). They also gave us Delta vouchers to put towards a ticket for our next flight. So we bought tickets to visit family overseas later with our vouchers and it was the biggest mistake of our lives. Our connecting flight was delayed because of weather- but they just kept pushing the time every 10 minutes making you think you would be able to really make it to our connecting international flight at JFK. We got on the plane 5 hours late and made it to the gate at JFK for our flight about 10 minutes before it was scheduled to depart. Well they didn't let us board the plane because they closed the door already (ok fine they said it was a security issue) so we watched our plane take off without us and mind you its already midnight at this point. So we are directed by the staff to go to the Delta counter so we did that. There was one woman at the desk that was eager to leave and she said that the next flight was overbooked by 16 people (no surprise we noticed that Delta tends to overbook their flights and basically makes people take one of their stupid vouchers just to re-experience Delta again) and that she could put us on a flight with one connection - but we would basically be getting to our destination 3 days later than we were originally supposed to. We are on vacation time off work and are going overseas to a country that is far away to see close family so every minute counts - she handed us what looked to be tickets but later we found out were just itineraries. So we could not go back through TSA to the ""nicer"" part of the terminal where there were comfortable chairs and food because we didn't have official tickets. Panic set in and were stranded at the airport with only 2 stalls available to go to the bathroom and no where to comfortably sit. My mom was able to get tickets for us on the flight that was supposedly overbooked and she was also told that we would get reimbursed for a hotel room should we choose to get one. There were no Delta agents at airport that could help us with anything. We contacted Delta to try to get reimbursed and we were sent in circles no manager available to help etc kept telling us to visit the Delta site and use the number there - even though we already did that they accused us of basically making up the fact that someone told us we would get reimbursed? So after 2 hours of getting no where we were fed up. Many other people I know have had bad experiences with Delta they warned us before we booked with them. I heard many people at the various airports we were at saying they will never fly Delta again and I agree."
10025,Delta Air Lines,19-May-14,Canada,9,Economy,5,YES,YUL-JFK-NRT-HKG. It was my first time flying Delta. I usually fly Japan Airlines or any other Asian airlines because of all the bad experiences I had with US based Airlines. From the check in agent I was greeted with a big smile. The planes were clean flight attendants full of energy and smile. To my surprise the captain apologize for the slight delay we had from JFK to Narita. That is something you hear only on Asian Airlines. The seats were comfortable for economy and the food was great!
10026,Delta Air Lines,18-May-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,Worst experience ever! Cancelled our connecting flight out of JFK leaving us stranded at their hell hole of a terminal for 20 hours and telling us that the next available flight was almost 3 days later. Employees spent their time sleeping chatting with one another or doodling on notepads. Bathrooms were disgusting. Every employee gave us different and conflicting information or showed no interest in helping us at all. Lost our bag and then told us that they wouldn't ship it to us we had to drive back to our final airport destination and pick it up. I will never fly with Delta ever again.
10027,Delta Air Lines,18-May-14,USA,7,First Class,4,YES,Return leg of a paid first class ticket LAS-ATL-GSO. Seemed like circumstances were lining up to give my wife and I a major headache - Bad weather on the East Coast late (mechanical not weather) departure from LAS tight connection in ATL and no seats ex LAS going anywhere East. Helpful agent and supervisor booked hotel in ATL in case we misconnected but we didn't need to have worried a fine tailwind got us to ATL in time for our connection. Newer planes on these 2 legs; the aircraft on the LAS-ATL leg even had a rudimentary IFE system. However my joy was short lived as my headphone jack didn't work and I was denied the opportunity to watch reruns of a few TV programs. Food was fair (basically the same as the outbound journey) seat comfortable service attentive ground staff throughout helpful and efficient. I'll stick with Delta through this purple patch they are enjoying.
10028,Delta Air Lines,18-May-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"All flights delayed some due to weather others to ""no staff for flight crew"". Missed all connection flights. Help desk staff extremely rude and condescending especially in JFK. Will never ever fly this airline again. Info given by crew 10 min before landing late regarding new gate and terminal incorrect."
10029,Delta Air Lines,17-May-14,USA,1,Business,1,NO,"I just tried Delta's ""Business Elite"" from JFK to BOG on a 737-700 and what a ripoff! These ""premium"" seats offer a pitch of just 37 inches (that's less than JetBlue's premium economy); they also recline quite a bit and the result is a wedge experience which made for one of the most uncomfortable flights I can remember. I couldn't even open my computer until my neighbor decided to join his wife in much more comfortable bulkhead coach. Soft service was fine and dinner actually surprisingly good accompanied by a decent German Riesling. But seating comfort is still paramount and this was unacceptable."
10030,Delta Air Lines,17-May-14,USA,7,Business,2,NO,The gate experience is good with staff pointing the way. This is especially good at Paris DeGaulle where there are endless gates and lines and confusion. Once on board the experience lessens as the attendants seemingly are frequently tired and occasionally indifferent. I have never been hot (not warm but hot as in a cabin temp of the high 70's) on an overseas flight. A request to a attendant brought the equivalent of a sleepy shrug. The food is edible and the presentation tries to be quality but it falls flat with the quality of the food and the occasional rush to serve and clear. I hate the business class pods - ok for the sleeper or someone doing work but impossible to talk or interact at all with a companion. Baggage handling is excellent for sky priority. Delta clubs vary from seedy (JFK) to nice. Nothing as nice as the Air France clubs at Paris CDG.
10031,Delta Air Lines,17-May-14,USA,7,First Class,4,YES,Paid for 1st class GSO-ATL-LAS. Delta continues to do a good job in their attempt to be a cut above the other Legacy airlines? Flights were on time check in and boarding easy food good. Service prompt and efficient if not jaunty. The flaw in the program in my view is the age and features of the equipment. DL's policy is to fly them until they run out of hours and our sky veterans had amassed 51 years between them! No IFE on either flight an ugly and not overly comfortable first class seat and 25 year old bathrooms - my ongoing pet peeve with DL.
10032,Delta Air Lines,13-May-14,Canada,10,Economy,5,YES,I flew from YYZ to Detroit to Seoul I was sceptical at first flying Delta because of all the negative reviews. I am very pleased with the whole experience. Enough leg room great entertainment system and great food. I love the snack bags in the middle of the night and bottles of water. Little details really makes a huge difference the ear plug and eye cover warm wipes and cold wipes after boarding and when you wake up. Even the washroom is roomy. Flight attendants are efficient. I will definitely try to fly Delta whenever I can.
10033,Delta Air Lines,9-May-14,UK,9,Economy,4,YES,Flew PDX to AMS. Flight departed slightly late but actually arrived early. At check-in I enquired as to whether I could pay to upgrade myself to business class but they said they don't have such a program for last minute upgrades which was rather odd as other airlines regularly do it for a fee. Having said that in many ways I was glad I didn't as my normal economy seat was extremely comfy with loads of personal space. Delta has the best inflight entertainment system I have used with a massive selection of entertainment. Having said that they really need to do something about their meals as they were awful and almost as bad as Air Canada. I didn't eat my main course as it smelt awful food but was supposed to be beef stroganoff. The food was the only thing to let Delta down as their cabin crew were friendly and efficient making sure we had regular supplies of water to keep us hydrated. Id definitely fly Delta again but would order a special meal to see if said meal would be better.
10034,Delta Air Lines,7-May-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Flying to Detroit From Tampa on a 737-800. Service on the plane: it was a good experience. Flight Attendants were polite and cared about me and other passengers (unlike United and BA). Food was only pretzels and cookies and a drink of choice (it was only a 2hr flight). Seats were comfortable. Service in the airport-Good service no long lines and friendly airport crew! I enjoyed Delta and will fly them again!
10035,Delta Air Lines,6-May-14,USA,6,Economy,3,YES,"DCA-ATL-DCA MD-90; Economy. ""We love to fly and it shows"" used to be Delta's slogan. Standards have slipped a lot since then. DCA counter bag drop-off was prompt after online check-in and the outbound flight was on time. It is amazing how many seats they have crammed into this aircraft recently to make money from Economy Comfort seats. The seat itself is reasonably comfortable for about two hours but the reduced legroom is awful. I am average height so I feel for taller people. Both planes were very clean and appeared well-maintained for 18+ year-old aircraft. A drink and mini pretzles were served on both flights. ATL bag drop-off after online check-in was quite quick. The inbound flight was delayed by 75 minutes but they made-up 25 minutes of that lost time. Flight attendants outbound were friendlier than those inbound. Overall this type of service will be acceptable for two to three hour flight segments and I will use Delta again."
10036,Delta Air Lines,5-May-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,We flew from Atlanta to Portland the check in process was chaotic and disorganized. We had checked in online but had not printed our boarding passes. One representative told us to leave the line and finalize the check in at the kiosk. We got out of line to do this and the kiosk was out of paper we got back in line and the same rep told us to go back to the kiosk - we refused. There was only one kiosk working at this time! The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight! In addition there is so little leg room that it is ridiculous and so uncomfortable. I did not feel like the staff were very friendly or helpful. On a positive note our plane landed on time and our luggage was there too.
10037,Delta Air Lines,5-May-14,UK,8,Business,5,YES,Flew MAN-ATL-HNL and LIH-LAX-ATL-MAN in Business Elite/First. Outbound flatbeds on both legs although I found the 'herringbone' 330 better than the 'offset' 767. Food and drink good on both but I noticed that Delta have stopped their wonderful hot nuts on Business Elite (MAN-ATL) but they were still served on First (ATL-HNL). Return LIH-LAX was delayed 3.5 hours due to computer failure at LAX. Delta contacted us (unlike United) so we were able to delay our arrival at Kauai Airport (LIH). The 757 on this route was very tatty with a number of broken footrests and ought to be retired. We made the connection at LAX and ATL and arrived at MAN 30 minutes early. Refreshments on the two First segments were acceptable and excellent on Business Elite. The staff on all flights were very attentive.
10038,Delta Air Lines,5-May-14,USA,0,Business,3,NO,Flight 387 from GUA to LAX on 4/26/2014. Delta procedures at GUA appalling! Each time I fly back on this route things get worse. It appears that you can no longer check in at a counter. After taking our 6 bags to the check in counter we were told to go back to kiosks to do our check in while the Delta employees sat around. If this was a domestic flight I would say there would be no issue. The fact that you have to attempt scanning of passports makes things a bit more difficult especially if you're not used to it. This process took an additional 20 minutes for the 4 of us. As the check in area isn't air conditioned the extra wait time left us sweaty and fed-up by the time we made it to the gate. Plane was late coming in. While waiting in the boarding line we looked to find that 3 of 4 seats had been changed. We went back to the ticket desk at the gate and fortunately were able to get our old seats back. By the time we got onto the plane and took our seats it was apparent that Delta lets babies travel in the first class cabin. The next 6 hours on the plane were frequently interrupted by a two year old that couldn't be controlled by her mother. The flight attendants tried to pacify the child but stopped short of requesting the mother take her child back to economy with the rest of her family. The screaming child aside cabin crew service was great. My four year old was again able to visit the cockpit but found little to do afterwards a this 757-200 only had communal IFE. Either watch the screen in front of the plane or watch nothing else: none of the music stations worked either. Food so-so but drink/snack runs frequent. If a drink/snack was requested in-between nothing was too much trouble. The final act of the Delta ground crew was to bus us to the Bradley Terminal after landing. It took 2 hours from the time the plane landed until we got our bags and I was surprised they were still on the carousel once clearing customs. After all most other international flights come through this terminal. The morning flight always has customs clearance at Terminal 5. If flying Delta was all one had to do it might not be such a bad experience as the flight crews are great. It's the pre post and sometime in-flight policies that Delta management have dreamt up that will make me never fly Delta on this route again. We paid for these tickets as opposed to upgrading so to say we were let down is an understatement. Next time it will be Taca/Avianca.
10039,Delta Air Lines,5-May-14,USA,2,Premium,1,NO,May 1 2014 Washington DC (DCA) to Minneapolis St. Paul (MSP). I bought an economy class ticket but Delta gave me an economy plus seat. Economy plus had a little more legroom and padding than economy but the seat recline was almost the same as in economy - I couldn't tell the difference. Based on this experience I would not pay extra for economy plus. Delta charged $2.00 for headsets with which to listen to a movie displayed on overhead screens situated every 4-6 rows. I didn't buy the headsets or food so I can't comment on catering or entertainment. Boarding has turned into an unpleasant experience passengers crowding the gate so they can board first and secure overhead bin space. My flight experience deteriorates each time I fly Delta. My spouse is a Platinum frequent flyer which is the only reason I patronize this airline -- no cost award tickets. I can't wait to fly Southwest or Jet Blue (domestic) or Air France KLM Lufthansa international. It seems as though the smiling CEO on the inflight video has nothing but contempt for his economy class passengers.
10040,Delta Air Lines,4-May-14,UK,3,Economy,2,NO,Flight DL0187 Date: Apr 25 2014. More expensive than other airlines. Lunch was served at 10am GMT 2 hours after departure! They had a lot of time to serve it later as we still had more than 5 hours ahead (going to Boston MA USA). You had to pay for entertainment. Many empty seats in first row but you cannot take them without paying extra! Attendant was chatting too much and very loudly and I couldn't sleep. Many broken seats won't come back to straight vertical position. They didn't have any diet or light soda but Fresca.
10041,Delta Air Lines,4-May-14,Switzerland,10,Economy,5,YES,Flight 67 to Atlanta connecting to flight 1384 to Orlando on April 28. My mother returned home from Zurich to Orlando after visiting us in Europe. Unfortunately while here she spent time in the hospital. Various Delta employees with whom we were in contact were extremely helpful in rebooking flights and assisting her before during and after her flights including wheelchair support. She enjoyed the flight (in economy comfort) the service the food etc. As a family we have flown Delta during many years and continue to be impressed with the airline more so recently with the many improvements they have and are implementing. We will happy continue to recommend Delta airlines.
10042,Delta Air Lines,4-May-14,USA,5,First Class,0,NO,Just returned from: IND to SJU via ATL. First class on IND-ATL segments (MD 90) and so-called Business Elite on ATL-SJU segments (737-800). On all segments aircraft interiors were clean and well maintained and cabin attendants were good. Boarding on all flights was total chaos and food on the ATL-SJU segments was inedible. No food on other segments. Seats not what one would call comfortable or roomy. Not worth the price paid.
10043,Delta Air Lines,4-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline. These are the worst airline seats I've experienced. Delta offered a thin blanket but no pillow. I was unable to sleep. The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable. Delta didn't offer food for purchase on these flights and I didn't pay the $2.00 for a headset on the SFO to DTW flight so I am unable to rate food or entertainment (I gave Delta one star for each).
10044,Delta Air Lines,2-May-14,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,The food was disgusting and the fact that I was travelling from the UK to the USA and there was no entertainment was horrendous. My kids had to look at the front of a seat for 8 hrs and my daughter had to sit on my lap but she could not sit properly because there was no space. When we got given food it kept going everywhere because we were so squashed. The loos were dirty and small. The staff were no good they didn't help out. I wouldn't recommend them.
10045,Delta Air Lines,1-May-14,Canada,2,Economy,2,NO,Flew Atlanta to Seattle. It is a 5 hour flight. If you want to eat you have to buy your meal however they do not have enough sandwiches so when the cart got to the end of the plane there was nothing left. If you want to watch a movie you have to pay $6.00. It costs $30.00 to check each bag. Just be aware that the price you pay for your ticket is just to get you from a to b just like greyhound.
10046,Delta Air Lines,30-Apr-14,USA,10,First Class,5,YES,Flew from LAX-ATL on B777-200 then ATL-CMH on A319. Both legs were great and crew very attentive. First class seat on the B777 was a comfortable seat if somewhat difficult to settle into at first. The A319 was uncomfortable and took a while to find that special spot to get comfortable. All considered the service I got for what I paid was excellent. Bags were first off the carousel and waiting when I got there which I liked a lot. Only issue was the miserable check in lady in LAX. DL also need to re think their lounge policy for First class passengers.
10047,Delta Air Lines,29-Apr-14,Canada,2,Economy,1,NO,The review is for Delta which was our return flight home from Pittsburgh. We were to leave on Flight DL 5217 on 20 April. Delta Airlines has a poor fleet of plains. They were under staffed and had 2 mechanical breakdowns and were unable to find us other flights. We needed to be home for surgery the next day and paid extra to fly out on Easter. Because we booked with Expedia they said that they Delta was not to blame (they blamed United). Worst case of passing the buck ever! (Only bright spot were the front line staff - like the desk agents who remained 3 hours extra to rebook all the passengers).
10048,Delta Air Lines,29-Apr-14,UK,10,Economy,4,YES,MAN-Atlanta Atlanta-Memphis Memphis-Las Vegas Las Vegas-Salt Lake City Salt Lake City-Memphis Memphis- Detroit Detroit-Amsterdam April 2014. All of our America trip was with Delta and everyone was excellent in every way. From check in to boarding to seat leg room were superb. The pilot and cabin crew were so friendly the captain thanked everyone on each flight personally standing at the entrance with the cabin crew. 7 out of our 8 holiday flights were with delta and we had no problems with any one was with KLM see that review.
10049,Delta Air Lines,28-Apr-14,Ireland,5,Economy,1,NO,Travelled Dublin to Salt Lake return trip. I normally travel BA which is good but in comparison Delta is a horrible travel experience. The flight attendants are fine but the aircraft used on all four segments were very old and there was a 'domestic' feel to flight that you just don't get with BA which in comparison has newer and cleaner and more spacious aircraft. Perhaps the biggest issue was that Delta typically fly 757 aircraft compared to BA's use of 747 or A380. It just felt far too cramped for long haul. The biggest insult was having paid > $2000 for a return flight to being given a 'beaker' of 100% plonk despite having asked for 'red wine'. I really wanted a glass of wine but if there was a plant nearby I would have dumped it there it was absolutely foul - I'm not a wine snob and would drink anything reasonable but this drink poured from a large container was sickening. I'd fly Delta again but only as a last resort. Having said that the flights were all on time or early maybe lucky but I'd hate to be delayed if the only wine they had onboard in 'coach' was what they gave me on those flights. One more thing although they had VOD the content on offer was very limited with only a handful of movies on offer (in contrast BA usually offer > 30 movies with similar ratios for TV and Music).
10050,Delta Air Lines,28-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Flight from Atlanta to Jacksonville NC canceled due to mechanical problem. Their solution was to spend the night in Atlanta at our cost and fly to Jacksonville 20 hours later. Ended up fling to Raleigh and renting a car at our cost and driving to Jacksonville. They are not concerned in the least. Will avoid Delta in the future.
10051,Delta Air Lines,23-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,Flight from MSN to LGA going east was very good. Return west was very poor with cancellation of late night flight and re-booking for next morning and long (2.5 hours) delay on morning flight due to a mechanical problem after plane was loaded and de-icing equipment issue in Mid-April at LGA. Very long and stressful flight experience.
10052,Delta Air Lines,22-Apr-14,UK,9,Economy,5,YES,Flew LHR-JFK and connecting internal flights to MCO. Excellent service at the airport and onboard. Very helpful and friendly cabin crew on all legs of the journey. Planes were clean and comfortable despite being a little old. Flight crews were very informative about potential turbulence flight times etc. There was a good selection of up to date movies and TV series available on personal entertainment screens for the long haul parts. Cabin crew would frequently offer drinks served dinner and a breakfast plus newspapers and other amenities on this section. Punctual and a pleasant experience. Would definitely fly with them again.
10053,Delta Air Lines,17-Apr-14,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,Madison WI to Gainesville FL via Atlanta. Flight delayed by a few hours leaving Madison. There was a decent snowstorm going on at the time and I presumed that was the cause of the delay. Arrived late in Atlanta and just missed the connecting flight to Gainesville. Delta staff at Atlanta said the delay was actually due to mechanical reasons and promptly provided meal and hotel vouchers for an excellent hotel and rebooking on the first flight the following morning. Obviously the delayed flight is a negative but in this particular case Delta efficiently made adequate accommodations for stranded passengers in a situation where it would have been easy for them to blame the weather and refuse to make accommodations at all. For that they deserve some commendation.
10054,Delta Air Lines,16-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Horrible service horrible planes Delta does not care about their passengers. No matter what happens they only have on excuse - technical problems with the plane. I booked my flights with Delta because the price is usually $30-50 cheaper but I've learned my lesson - it's not worth it. (I fly about 10 times a year and have done so for last 6 years) I don't remember their flight being ever on time. They've failed 100 out of 100 times. I wish everyone would stop flying with them just to show them that in order to stay in business they have to take care of their customers.
10055,Delta Air Lines,15-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I have flown Delta for 20 years and the last few have become completely horrible. The company does not appear to care about the customer any longer. The seats have shrunk to petite size on most flights and I am fairly thin. My knees are in the back of the seat in front of me when I am in coach. The flights are consistently late on departure and arrival. The flights are typically oversold which creates a capacity issue for their service. As a frequent flyer and a business person I can understand the need to increase operating margins but at what cost? I think the executive team should eat their own dog food and ride non-private flights. I am considering abandoning my gold status at Delta for an airline that can do more than lip service.
10056,Delta Air Lines,15-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Booked on Delta flight out of a local regional airport MLI to New Bern North Carolina via connection in Atlanta. Flight was scheduled to depart at 4.59pm. It was pushed back to 7.30 as the incoming flight out of Atlanta has mechanical problems and they were bringing in another plane. Flight delayed a second time to 8.39pm and cancelled. Both at the delay and cancellation the customers had to leave the secure area and go back out to the ticket counter. We were told the flight was cancelled because the crew timed out. All flights on Delta out of Chicago and United were booked. They have no reciprocating agreement with Southwest or U.S. Air and could not see their reservation. Delta told us to come back the next day at 4.50 for that flight. We finally via the internet were able to book a flight earlier the next day out of Chicago with U.S. Air for $400 more than the original ticket. We had purchased insurance through Alliance. Delta would only refund the ticket price and would not pay the difference. The people at the ticket counter were less than helpful they had given up and didn't care. I won't be flying Delta again not if I can help it at least. U.S air was on time and staff was very friendly.
10057,Delta Air Lines,14-Apr-14,France,3,Economy,2,NO,"AF3628 (operated by Delta) Paris-NY JFK 6th April. Extremely disappointed with Delta the only normal element was that the flight was on time. The staff service was not pleasant and not helpful. The lavatory (even before taking off) was dirty. No newspapers (we'll give you whatever will be left after business class passengers have been served). The food was appalling and a horrible non-descript sandwich (which almost everyone put aside) should not be called a ""meal"". What a trip."
10058,Delta Air Lines,14-Apr-14,Canada,8,Economy,4,YES,I went DTW-SFO AND SFO-DTW. Took Delta Airlines Boeing 767-300 both ways. The seat comfort was great! There was a lot of leg room. The staff wasn't very friendly. They weren't smiling that much or very polite. There was a lot of food selection and prices were decent. We got complimentary drinks twice which was great. The inflight entertainment system has a ton of selection although most of the movies and tv shows cost money. But the music selection was amazing so it was great. Overall the Delta flights were really good and I would definitely fly it again.
10059,Delta Air Lines,9-Apr-14,USA,0,Business,1,NO,"Extremely dissatisfied with Delta. Original flight delayed with no explanation. Missed connecting flight by 5 minutes. The next flight I was able to get on and still make my appointment at my destination - at boarding time was advised of ""mechanical issues"" and not sure of length of delay. For the price of airfare this lack of service and commitment is unacceptable."
10060,Delta Air Lines,9-Apr-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,I fly international in economy class from Seattle (SEA) to Japan (NRT) about twice every month. I have flown this route more than 10 times already and with a variety of different airlines. At first I was sceptical about flying with Delta but Delta has made up a lot of ground recently in my opinion. While Delta is no match for Singapore airline's service and no match for ANA's food it does beat out United airlines in both of these categories. One major problem I have with Delta's international flight is that they really only served one meal whereas Singapore and ANA gave you a full 2 meals. Over a 9-10 hour flight having only one major meal feels a little lacking and will leave you hungry walking off the plane. The food that is served is also not exciting but gets the job done. In-flight entertainment is good with plenty of choices and nice screen size/brightness. I fly often so this is particularity important especially over such a long segment. Seat comfort is mediocre but its economy so you get what you pay for however I have used Premium Economy seating with Delta and I'd have to say its worth the few extra $. If flying ANA on this segment on a 787 Dreamliner your Regular Economy seating will outclass Deltas Premium Economy seats however. To rap up I'd say since Delta is usually 100$ cheaper than the other competitors mentioned above you really get what you pay for.
10061,Delta Air Lines,3-Apr-14,UK,10,Business,5,YES,DL010 ATL-LHR on 7th March. Very tight connection from Dallas through Atlanta made the flight with minutes to spare and my bags made it onto the flight too! Extremely attentive cabin staff comfortable lie flat bed good selection of food and drink IFE was a little dated but didn't mind as was tired and needed the sleep. Flight arrived early quick bag delivery. All round great experience.
10062,Delta Air Lines,31-Mar-14,Germany,9,Economy,5,YES,We had a very good flight from DUS to LAX with transfer in ATL. Service on both flights was good even if meals on the inner-USA flight were not for free.
10063,Delta Air Lines,31-Mar-14,Germany,9,Economy,5,YES,Our flight from LAX to JFK was on time and we arrived earlier than planned. Service was a little slow due to the reason they don't accept cash payment for meals and Credit Card verification wasn't that fast. Inflight entertainment was really good!
10064,Delta Air Lines,31-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,Economy Comfort DTW-LAX on a 767-300 and LAX-DTW on a 737-900. To LAX the 767-300 seat was good although it did not have the adjustable headrest. Multiple drink runs and plenty of cookies peanuts and pretzels. Personal entertainment had okay choices. Back to DTW the 737-900 was great. Seats were very comfortable. Again multiple drink runs and lots of snacks. Purchased the fruit/cheese tray and tapas both of which were very good. The personal entertainment had tons of movies. Overall - very good experience. I hope that all aircraft get seats with adjustable headrests as they do make a difference on a 4+ hour flight.
10065,Delta Air Lines,26-Mar-14,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,Paid $622 for so-called Sky Priority First Class from Detroit to Tampa. What a joke! My checked bag was taken off the non-stop because they were overweight. I guess Sky Priority means they ditch your bag before everyone else. Planes are filthy. First class lavatory filthy. First class crowded with coach passengers using forward lavatory. No attempt by FAs to deter this. First overheads filled with coach luggage. Several first class flights last year on AA were terrific also first on Icelandair - also terrific. Save your money - Delta is now a low cost low service airline do not bother to pay for First class.
10066,Delta Air Lines,26-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,3/24/14 I was set to departing from Atlanta to Greensboro NC on flight DL4933 and returning from Greensboro NC to Atlanta on DL1461. Upon boarding I noticed that there was a climate issue on the flight where half of the plane was extremely cold and the back half of the flight was unbearably hot. I was not the only passenger to complain to no avail to the flight staff. After about 30min on the runway with no movement we were notified that there was an engine malfunction and all passengers would need to depart the aircraft. We were told at 8.50am that the maintenance would take an hour at the most. It is now 10.33am and there has been no resolution to the situation. The ladies at the customer care center across from D27 have been the only people to attempt to assist me. I attempted to inform the representatives at the departure gate (D13) that I was attempting to go to a funeral and any options would be appreciated and they stated that they understood and asked me to take a seat and wait. As a result of my flight not being ready to depart Atlanta at 10.40am and the viewing in Winston-Salem NC beginning at 11.00am I was unable to pay my respects.
10067,Delta Air Lines,26-Mar-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"I flew LA to NYC on a red-eye flight this past Sunday March 23rd. The boarding process was an absolute nightmare and that was in part due to some horrible service (more to come). More than 15 people had to check in their bags and all passengers in Economy that could keep their luggage on board were having to put their belongings aisles down in the bins creating a huge mess upon landing. While entering the plane and attempting to put our things away we were ""greeted"" by an extremely sarcastic condescending and ""rudely-friendly"" air hostess who would individually call out any person taking longer than 15 seconds to put away their things. After embarrassing quite a few passengers including myself who were tired and exhausted and about to take a 6 hour red-eye she proceeded to call one passenger ""cute very handsome "" and helped him out by putting his luggage in first class. A few minutes later after everyone else was told to check in their bags a mother came in with a son with special needs stated she had to keep her luggage on board because his medicines and change of clothes were all in there and the hostess proceeded to tell her there's nothing she can do except give her a bag for her medicines. After take-off (which was 25 minutes late) the passengers proceeded to sleep (as one does past midnight) and the air hostesses (namely the sarcastic one) proceeded to talk at full volume inconsiderate of the passengers. As a side note the other hostesses were quite nice. After 6 hours on a rather uncomfortable seat we started our decent with yet again the sarcastic hostess picking out her two favorite passengers and offering them secret mimosas while the rest of us looked on. Not a good experience pretty frustrating and undoubtedly embarrassing."
10068,Delta Air Lines,24-Mar-14,UK,8,Economy,4,YES,Flew Washington to London via Atlanta. Flight from Washington to Atlanta was fine drinks service and pretzels provided however bad weather meant the service was suspended. Annoying the flight was full and warnings were given about hand luggage due to the flight being full however quite a lot of other passengers had loads of luggage including massive cases that would normally be checked in. Flight from Atlanta to London was fine meal service delayed due to bad weather but meal was tasty and full drinks service offered. On demand TV with good selection would definitely fly Delta again.
10069,Delta Air Lines,24-Mar-14,USA,9,Business,5,YES,BOS-ATL-LIM-ATL-BOS in Business Class. Flight experience was excellent. Great crews very comfortable lay-flat bed seating wonderful IFE superb meals. Additionally very good wines offered. I have never had aged wines on a flight before. The return from LIM to ATL was canceled due to a mechanical issue and DL had to fly the part down on their flight from ATL the next day. DL did a commendable job accommodating the over 200 passengers. Excellent pro-active customer service. The only part of this trip that was any type of letdown was the Club in ATL in Terminal E. The Club was packed the seating awkward and uncomfortable the food offerings pretty bad and the Wifi so slow it was unusable. The BOS Club was great however. All in all a very good experience yet again with DL.
10070,Delta Air Lines,22-Mar-14,Canada,2,Economy,2,NO,Flew Jan 22 from Burlington VT to Tampa FL. They changed planes giving us a smaller one so they ran out of seats they offered compensation took the flight up to Atlanta GA. No heating on plane we were freezing attendants kept there coats on for the trip. No hot drinks peanuts pretzels or soft drinks. Next flight to Tampa was ok on way back the plane land in LaGuardia NY put us onboard waited an 1 hour before leaving while the plane was being de-iced they had only one truck there to de-ice 3 planes. They compensate us with peanuts and pretzels - very disappointed with Delta.
10071,Delta Air Lines,17-Mar-14,USA,10,Business,5,YES,Flew GSO to CZM through ATL. We received complimentary upgrades to business class. The meal was the best meal I have had on a plane and the sandwich and puree would have rivalled sandwich shops. Everything was excellent. The seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were helpful and courteous. Highly recommend.
10072,Delta Air Lines,17-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Our flight to Tulsa has been delayed for almost 5 hours. During this time we have not been given satisfactory updates. We've only been told mechanical difficulties. 5 hours later they are still trying to decide if they will bring another plane. I will not fly Delta in the future.
10073,Delta Air Lines,17-Mar-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,DL1467 13 Mar ATL-SAN. Flight operated with 767 equipment. As with all DL west coast flights medallion upgrades limited to a very few high Diamonds (I am a platinum medallion and was about 17 on the list for 5 upgrade seats). However the Economy Comfort seat was quite comfortable but more importantly the inflight service was superb. Flight time was 4hrs 15mins and the somewhat senior cabin crew provided non-stop service. Two drink runs water in between and a flight attendant always in the aisle. Special requests fulfilled graciously. This was true Delta service from the heart and was to me a benchmark of what DL can be. Even though I am a Million Miler I was impressed by one of the best flights I have had.
10074,Delta Air Lines,17-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,Flew DL007 from DXB to ATL. I have traveled this flight 12 or more times. Most of the time my experience is always positive. This specific trip the IFE was not working very well for the first 3+ hours of the flight. They had to reset the system about 4 or 5 times. I was seated in 44J (Exit row window seat). I always sit in Row 44 which is the row with nothing in front of you. I am a frequent flyer so I have this option. The food was decent. The mid flight snack is normally just a turkey sandwich and a mini banana. You can normally get one drink with your meal just ask for it. The flight attendants are very kind every time on this flight. Sometimes you get a joker too. The bathrooms always become quite disgusting but that's understandable on a 15 hour flight. I enjoyed my flight but will be flying Business class with my miles next flight.
10075,Delta Air Lines,17-Mar-14,USA,8,Business,5,YES,Flew CZM to ATL. We were supposed to leave on 28th January but didn't end up leaving until 30th January. This obviously wasn't the airlines fault so you cannot give them a worse score for the weather. We were complimentary upgraded to business class on this flight but since the plane had landed the night prior they didn't have the hot meal we received on the way down. They did however give us all the cookies and chips and any other snacks they had. Along with liquor. The seats were very comfortable and the flight attendants were very courteous. Overall a great flight.
10076,Delta Air Lines,14-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,Rochester to Ft Lauderdale through Atlanta 3/6/14 - 3/9/14. I was very happy with two aspects and unhappy with one. We taxied from the gate in Atlanta found there were tornadoes in Florida and turned back to the gate. The speed with which we were told what happened and with which Delta decided to bring us back to the gate were beyond anything I've recently experienced from the airlines. I was very impressed with the kindness and quick solution when I got home after the trip realized I left a book on the plane called the airport held it for me and I got it back two days later. My one complaint was with the one hour line to get through TSA at 5 am March 9 in Ft Lauderdale-I think Delta blames this on TSA. Overall very satisfied with Delta.
10077,Delta Air Lines,12-Mar-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,PHL-CDG-PHL on a Boeing 757ER. Went on a family vacation to Paris back in July 2013. Leaving Philly the flight left on time at 9pm and got to Paris 30 minutes early around 10.15am. Flight wasn't full so I went to an empty row to lay down for the almost 8hr flight. Each seat had TV's in the headrest and the plane had wifi but flying over the Atlantic ocean the wifi didn't. The food served wasn't the best and the complimentary breakfast was a joke they gave us OJ a banana and a blueberry muffin. Leaving Paris we had an hour delay because of a storm and when we finally boarded the plane we had another half hour delay because a family of 10 had a virus and were all forced to get off. My original seat flying from Paris was changed without any notification prior to the vacation. Luckily my mother checked the flights each day to make sure nothing bad happened to our flights. The flight was full minus the family who got kicked off the plane. For the almost 8hr flight you would think they would use a 2 aisle plane instead of one. My TV didn't work. For long haul flights I doubt I'll take Delta again.
10078,Delta Air Lines,12-Mar-14,Canada,10,Economy,5,YES,Feb 25th flight DL4884 DL4938 / March 4TH DL5355 DL892 DL4682. I had not ever flown with Delta before last week. I have been very impressed with the customer service as well as the price. Atlanta airport was daunting first time round but the second visit was much easier to work through.
10079,Delta Air Lines,3-Mar-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,Flight 2395 PBI-LGA on a MD-88 aircraft on July 30th. Only positive was an on time flight. Thankful this flight wasn't any longer then it was. Experience was awful and I felt very unwelcome as if I was an inconvenience. Flight crew were young and seemed new to the airline industry. I assumed they'd be into their job and enthusiastic I experienced the complete opposite. No hello or goodbye while entering and deplaning the aircraft by any crew member. Ticket scanner while boarding was not working so the rude gate agent was checking the tickets by hand. Crew rushed through the safety announcement and we were in the air within 5 minutes. Ok legroom however the armrests where painful to rest your arm on. Restrooms in rear were out of order leaving everyone on the plane to have to all use the one restroom in first class. Took about 30 minutes to receive my luggage at baggage claim. Overall not a pleasant experience.
10080,Delta Air Lines,3-Mar-14,USA,0,First Class,1,NO,"I have flown Delta for years because I live in metro Detroit. I am a frequent flyer and am in many ways ""stuck"" but after this experience I am going to find an alternative. I am sure my business does not matter however I think if one person tells one other and so on perhaps customers can have a voice! It is a shame that people cannot be treated better!"
10081,Delta Air Lines,3-Mar-14,Germany,10,Business,4,YES,CDG-MIN-DFW - great service - nice staff - managed to get me and my luggage in an 1 hour connection (got on the plane 15 min before take off).
10082,Delta Air Lines,27-Feb-14,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,I was travelling with my teenage son and 3 others on a flight to Boston. We received excellent service from everyone. The attendants encouraged our tall teenage boys to move to seats with more legroom as the flight was not full and supplied them with all the refreshments they asked for with a smile. They gave us great advise for when we landed. Extra cups of tea were not a problem and also came with delicious cookies! Our return flight a week later was even better with the same crew who were interested in our trip and how we had got on with the snowstorms. They again encouraged us to move for more room and once again all refreshments were served with a smile.
10083,Delta Air Lines,25-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Long and short of it is that it took a succession of 5 aircrafts last week to get from Detroit to Burlington VT. The first plane which left on time backed into a baggage cart. They couldn't find a crew for the replacement. Ended up spending the night in Detroit (at my expense) the 1st and 2nd aircraft the next morning both had mechanical issues. Customer Service in Detroit for the most part is the worst I've ever seen. Rude uninformed incompetent etc. Thanks to a fellow passenger who told me that a flight to Burlington had 14 empty seats I got home on aircraft #5. I usually fly Delta and have generally found their service to be very good. However they need to address the Customer Service issues in Detroit.
10084,Delta Air Lines,22-Feb-14,UK,7,Economy,5,YES,DL002 London Heathrow to JFK 15th Feb returned on 21st Feb flight KL6005 JFK to London Heathrow. This is the first time I have used Delta Airlines. The value for money was great. The meals were some of the best I have tasted inflight with a good selection. The entertainment was also extremely good with a vast selection to choose from. The staff were not warm and friendly and the plane was not cleaned to a great standard there were peanuts down the side of the chair that had been there for some time. The staff did not know who their partnership airlines were and we were advised to go to a different terminal due too this. Flying home from JFK seats were not allocated until the gate meaning on a night flight my daughter was on the opposite side of the plane to myself.
10085,Delta Air Lines,22-Feb-14,Australia,8,First Class,4,YES,"Flew from Seattle to Vegas on a ""cosy"" CRJ900. Service was friendly seat comfortable and snacks and drinks on offer were good for a 1hr 45min. Flight and bags were first on the carousel easily worth the extra $70 IMO."
10086,Delta Air Lines,21-Feb-14,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,Feb 7 2014. Frankfurt (Germany) to NYC (USA). All in all I had one of the best long distance flights in a while. The plane itself was new leg space was a lot better than for instance on Air Berlin flights. The safety video was the funniest I had seen. Delta definitely had the greatest selection of films I have seen on the plane although some of them had Russian/Chinese/Korean subtitles but I wasn't disturbed by that. I know a flight is not all about food but I was surprised by the variety of things served. The crew were generally very friendly and served the first round of drinks approximately an hour after take off followed by snacks (pretzels and salted peanuts) a fantastic hot lunch (chicken/rice/vegetables) and tea/coffee straight afterwards. The next round of snacks (same than before) was served a few hours later and 1.5 hours before landing we even got another meal this time a hot tomato-mozarella sandwich followed by ice-cream. I would certainly recommend flying with Delta.
10087,Delta Air Lines,21-Feb-14,UK,1,Economy,3,NO,After visiting Tucson AZ I was embarking on my return journey from Tucson to Edinburgh via Atlanta and Paris on Monday 17th Feb. The incoming flight from Atlanta arrived more or less on time but as soon as it landed it was clear there was a problem with the aircraft. It turns out that none of the lavatories were functional. This caused a severe delay making me reschedule my entire journey one day later. I was offered a hotel - which was fine - and given what was described to me as meal vouchers. These were not fine. They were in fact practically useless pieces of paper. No one took the time to explain that they were only valued at $6. A fact I was also unaware of until I came to pay and pay I did. As far as I am concerned if I am given a meal voucher I expect a meal. In fact this worthless piece of paper does not buy anything on the menu - even a bowl of soup. To add insult to injury there was no breakfast voucher at all. American airlines already have a bad reputation so perhaps I should not have expected better.
10088,Delta Air Lines,21-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Was scheduled from Milwaukee to Detroit to Norfolk VA on Thursday 2/13. Our plane in MKE was delayed over an hour because of weather. Because of that we missed our connection to Norfolk. The captain said we'd be rebooked on the next flight - we weren't. My three traveling companions and I couldn't be rebooked until Saturday 2/15 after our event was over. Delta's customer ""service"" area in the Detroit airport consist of a bank of phones with no human beings present. We were continually bounced between phone representatives and gate agents with neither being helpful. We ended up renting a car and driving (yes over 12 hrs) Avoid Delta at all costs."
10089,Delta Air Lines,18-Feb-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,DL 1169 MIA to LAX Feb 13 2014. It is impossible to get an upgrade as a Platinum Medallion between Florida and California on Delta. In addition the system wide upgrades are never available. Furthermore the planes are smaller always packed. After flying 2.5 million miles with Delta it clearly has gone downhill. Loyalty means nothing. If you fly from Florida to California often and need to try and do some work on the trip avoid Delta. Their upgrade policy is a classic bait and switch. My trip yesterday was like a 5 hour closed MRI. It is sad to see great airline go down the tubes in rewarding loyalty.
10090,Delta Air Lines,17-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"February 1 2014. CDG (Paris) to SEA (Seattle-Tacoma). I would have given Delta a higher score an 8 out of 10 for trip satisfaction but the seats on the aircraft were very uncomfortable (the worst I've experienced). The recline was minimal which made it impossible for me to sleep. I had to remove the catalogue / inflight magazine from the seat pocket in front of me in order to gain a 1/2 inch or so of leg space. I considered upgrading to economy comfort but only available seats were by the toilets and the seats were described as having ""up to"" 4 inches of additional leg room but no mention of additional recline. The seats are acceptable short flights but not for long-haul travel."
10091,Delta Air Lines,17-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,"I recently flew to Fort Wayne from Philly. Both ways had a lay over so I flew 4 separate planes. Of the 4 I had a broken seat on 3 of them. Not able to recline on 2 because it was broken and the other I had a broken seat cushion that repeatedly slid off making the flight that much more comfortable as I had to keep standing and fixing it. At least I was able to enjoy a beverage. Oh no I was not because 2 flights did not serve any and the last leg of my journey the 3 flight ""attendants"" were unable to fully serve the plan in the 70 min we were in the air. I have taken 20 min flights in Europe where I get served fresh tea and a biscuit by one flight steward for the entire plane. If ever have the displeasure of flying your airline I will be sure to bring duck tape a tool box and a coke so I can be comfortable."
10092,Delta Air Lines,10-Feb-14,USA,10,Business,5,YES,ATL-DUB Delta 176 in business class leaving Atlanta on November 22 and returning November 30 Delta 177.�The food was fantastic and filling. I liked the fact that there was a great selection of entrees both for the main meal and the meal prior to landing. The seat sort of reminded me of L'Espace Affaires on Air France in 2007. That said it was very comfortable. The only downside is that I was unable to sleep. The flight crew going to Dublin was nothing short of fantastic. The flight crew returning was great but not as good as the outgoing crew. The in- flight entertainment was OK. While I didn't explore as much on the outgoing flight I was able to watch 3 movies I had not seen on the return flight. The only real downside is that it cost me nearly double the frequent flier miles to fly for free than it had cost me when I flew Delta to Dublin in 2000. All in all a very positive experience.
10093,Delta Air Lines,10-Feb-14,Canada,0,Economy,1,NO,"Wife and I flying from Memphis Tenn. to Edmonton Alberta. Released from the Memphis hospital (after a stroke) on Sunday flying home the next day. When we booked the flight we requested we sit together due to my need for assistance. Reply ""No problem"" get to the airport check in we are in the same row. but her on one side of the plane I am on the other 2 people and 1 aisle between us. We explained the situation to the clerk they said ""No problem we will fix it at the gate."" Result - back seats in the plane no recline at all very limited space."
10094,Delta Air Lines,10-Feb-14,Ireland,7,Economy,3,YES,I flew from DUB-JFK-PHX. The transatlantic leg was enjoyable. The flight attendants did several drink runs although they only pour half a can unlike other airlines. Each passenger had their own personal backseat TV and the movie/music/game selection was fantastic. Headphones are provided for those didn't bring their own. Toilets were clean and hot towels are provided to freshen up. The second leg from JFK-PHX was less impressive. Entertainment is provided by an old CRT monitor in the centre of the aisle meaning you have no choice in what you watch. Expect old sitcom reruns. No meals on this flight either despite it being nearly as long as DUB-JFK. The boredom of this flights combined with my hunger meant I couldn't wait to get off. Conclusion: fly Delta transatlantic but avoid for domestic flights within the USA.
10095,Delta Air Lines,10-Feb-14,Canada,4,Economy,4,NO,Flew JNB-ATL-SNA on Feb 6 2014. Departure from JNB on time though boarding was a bit chaotic. Economy class seating on B77L from JNB-ATL ok. Weber slimline seats are a quite firm and this becomes ever more evident on this long 16 hour flight. Cabin crew most unfriendly and really did not want to be providing the on board services. In flight meals very poor. Cabin crew on ATL-SNA flight a little better. AVOD on B77L very good with excellent picture quality and selections.
10096,Delta Air Lines,3-Feb-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,I have flown Delta 3 round trips in the past 3 months. The first flight had an engine problem over the Atlantic and we had to make an emergency landing in Canada and were forced to sit on the plane for 6 hours waiting for a new plane. I do have to say the crew was great. Missing my connection I arrived home a day late. My second flight was normal with no issues. My trip had another engine problem. This time before take-off. Instead of getting home on Friday night I had to wait until Saturday night to get home. The crews and ground staff have been great but Delta is not maintaining its planes.
10097,Delta Air Lines,3-Feb-14,USA,10,First Class,5,YES,Honolulu to LA First class. Lucked out got a flight that was inbound from Japan so configuration was Intl business. Normally Hawaii routes get the oldest planes with the least amount of comfort. This was a wonderful surprise. Complemented by a wonderful crew that was eager to please with warm excellent service this flight was a pleasure. Great entertainment nice lunch warm service and tail winds.
10098,Delta Air Lines,3-Feb-14,Australia,8,Business,5,YES,BKK-NRT-BKK in Business Elite on B747. Don't fly Delta much and was impressed with the product. Seats comfortable and private whilst seated on upper deck. Cabin ambience pleasant service attentive and professional IFE above average. In general a cut above the other American carriers and significantly better than the previous Delta international business product. Only disappointment was not having Premium Lane cards for arrival in BKK. BKK can have lengthy immigration queues and all major carriers provide this 'fast track' card which is a must when arriving into BKK. I enquired about it with the crew and they were baffled and seemed to have no idea with what I was talking about as if they had never heard of it. Other than that very nice experience.
10099,Delta Air Lines,31-Jan-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,January 15th SLC to CDG. I would have purchased an economy comfort seat for the extra $210 but the only available ones were by the toilets. My economy seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have experienced on a long flight - inadequate seat padding and very limited recline. Otherwise the flight was acceptable the food edible the FAs competent performance on time. Next time I fly to Europe I'll avoid Delta on account of my experience with the uncomfortable seat. Based on my experience on this trip I would not recommend Delta to friends and family. I may fly Delta again but only on short domestic trips.
10100,Delta Air Lines,29-Jan-14,USA,7,Business,4,YES,"GSO-BKK and return via ATL and NRT. All flights on time and no issues with check in and boarding. All the long distance flights were on 747-400. Although you can no longer call these the ""Queen of the Sky"" they still give a comfortable reassuring ride. Delta can be complimented on upgrading their business class product. The fully flat bet is good. The duvet pillows amenity kit (no pyjamas!) and IFE are all excellent though the noise cancelling headset had connection issues on all flights. To compete with the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers though Delta needs to brush up on a few areas. In particular the menu selections and service need to be better but my biggest gripe is with the bathrooms which fully reflect the 25 year age of the plane and at the end of a 13 hour flight. I shall say no more."
10101,Delta Air Lines,25-Jan-14,Singapore,8,Economy,5,YES,SIN-NRT return. DL 622 and DL 621. Both flights were on 777-200ER equipped with on demand ptv. SIN-NRT: Could not find the USB port to charge my phones on the flight to NRT. Hot breakfast was served at local time 8 am 2hrs into the flight. Hot snack of chicken wrap was served 2 hrs before landing. The odd part was the entertainment programmes were switched off 4 hrs into the flight with no explanation. Most passengers were asleep due to the early departure of the flight at 5.45 am. NRT-SIN: USB port was installed beside the PTV. Hot dinner was served 2 hrs into the flight. Snack of ice cream were served 2 hrs before landing. Crew of Chinese national and Singaporean crew were helpful. Asked if passengers wanted extra ice cream. Self help galley provided Evian water only. DL offers the cheapest fare for direct flights to Japan and will travel with them again.
10102,Delta Air Lines,20-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,While the flight attendants on all the Delta flights were nice I've noticed the planes they use aren't the best of quality/maybe not well maintained and their customer service seems non-existent. On a flight I took recently from Moscow to NYC during both take off and landing the roof of the plane was leaking a lot of water (over passengers). If you were sitting in a window seat (like me) it seemed to leak quite a lot enough to get you wet. The leaking eventually stopped when the plane was higher up in the air. The flight attendants couldn't really do anything about it since it was an issue with the plane itself. I left bad feedback on the flight and filed a complaint and Delta never seems to respond. So next time I fly I will probably read more reviews on air carriers and try to pick one that's known for better service.
10103,Delta Air Lines,20-Jan-14,USA,7,First Class,3,YES,ATL-LAS December 2013. Main and pretty much only issue was legroom. In certain configurations of their 757-200 seats 2C/D are bulkhead seats where we were seated and legroom is severely restricted. Other than that it was a pretty average/decent experience. A snack basket containing the typical peanuts pretzels and chocolates was passed around twice. Flight attendants were courteous. The seat had a good amount of width and AC power outlets were available underneath. PTVs were also available with an excellent selection of holiday and other films. Since the flight departed around 9:30pm no complimentary dinner was served. All in all it was an OK flight just beware of the first class bulkhead seats on certain 757 configurations.
10104,Delta Air Lines,16-Jan-14,USA,10,Premium,5,YES,Flew on December 19 DEN-ATL-SRQ and return all flights were on time even with all the delays in the NE. One flight had PTV's on a 757 which was very nice other 3 flights on a md's nicely updated with power outlets in economy comfort which was very nice. Greeted nicely at each gate by name. All staff very professional and better than Delta or American without a doubt!
10105,Delta Air Lines,15-Jan-14,UK,8,Business,5,YES,Flew LHR-CUN (via ATL outbound and MSP return) in Business Elite. Pre-flight customer service (via Twitter) was excellent with the one or two queries we had. Check-in fast track security and lounge at LHR T4 very good - much better than BA at T5. Seats (flat beds) very good although foot area a little compact - we're 5'6 and 5'8 so taller travellers may be less happy. Pillow and duvet very comfortable. Food needs more investment - not terrible but not brilliant. In flight entertainment terrific but both our screens skipped and jumped on both legs (we were generously and quickly compensated for this post flight - excellent). Lack of lounge at CUN a bit disappointing on the return. We encountered many Delta staff on the journey - all are a cut above most airlines for the personal human touches. They genuinely engage. On board service excellent and friendly - on the outbound flight two crew (including the purser) came round with chocolates and thanked us for flying Delta they really sounded like they meant it. Will definitely fly Delta transatlantic again.
10106,Delta Air Lines,15-Jan-14,USA,5,First Class,3,NO,DL1954 on 12/30 and DL1910 on 1/1/14. Checking in with first class with Delta was nice because we got advanced security clearance. The rest was disappointing. I guess I am used to first class with American. Snacks offered were like sombody's left over Halloween treats. There was no music or entertainment offered.
10107,Delta Air Lines,14-Jan-14,USA,7,Economy,2,NO,Flew from JFK to Las Vegas January 9-12. Check-in was very good even at 6am. I liked the bistro in the waiting area. The plane was clean and orderly. The only real disappointment was the food and drink selection offered with the flight a tablespoon of peanuts or a shy dozen of mini-pretzels. The real disappointment (inflight) was with the entertainment as in none. The screen was jumping (and audio) as if the VCR was old and the screens had rainbow colors to them as if the TV's were well past their prime. Ok no problem I'll listen the music channels nothing not one channel other than the one tied into the screen. I was told by the flight attendant that they no longer offer it. For $600+ a seat it should be a lot better especially since last year was a banner year for profits for the airlines. How sad. This is America's best? Hey Delta pay it forward and invest in your equipment.
10108,Delta Air Lines,14-Jan-14,UK,0,First Class,1,NO,Used Delta from JFK to Fort Lauderdale and have to say that the experience was far from first class. Before takeoff a lady got on in a dishevelled state and distributed bottled water after she had stowed her luggage in an overhead locker. It turned out she was an off duty stewardess helping out the on duty staff. During the flight drinks were served and a banana was thrown to the first class passengers by way of food. The only good thing to be said was that the flight was on time.
10109,Delta Air Lines,13-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,My husband and 1 year old daughter was flying today (01/11/2014) from Charlotte to Albany through Detroit. Their flight got delayed 1 hr due to some mechanical repairs. Then they missed their connecting flight to Albany due to that delay. They ended up waiting from 12 Noon to 8pm for their next flight to Albany. By 8pm their flight got cancelled and got a new schedule for tomorrow. With connecting flight from Detroit-Atlanta-Albany. I don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. This type of incident happens for us for the third time. Very bad service of flights.
10110,Delta Air Lines,9-Jan-14,Singapore,9,Economy,5,YES,SIN-NRT-SIN. Economy. Delta may fail to meet expectation of many people who fly within the States but for international flight I find they do pretty well. The flight for both legs was on time and actually arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. I love their B777-200LR. I understand that Delta is an American airline so the seat was designed for a typical Caucasian. Thus the seat appears bigger and gave me more than enough space for the size of a typical Asian without upgrading my ticket. Meals were nice with various choice of beverage. There were a lot of choices for IFE from movies to music. Flight attendants were quite nice and helpful. The only minus point probably is long process of check-in at Changi (my bags were checked 3 times before boarding) which I understand due to fear of terror on flights to the US. Overall it was still a good experience especially the first time with Delta. I would definitely fly with them again for my trip to the USA some time in the future.
10111,Delta Air Lines,9-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,Flying round trip from Columbus OH to Las Vegas through Detroit. Jan 3-6 2014. Delta gate agents are rude and abrupt. They were late getting me to my connection in DTW due to computer problems during boarding at the gate in Columbus. I made it to the gate in DTW 12 min before departure but the agent had given away my seat and said sternly that it was to late and to go complain at gate A43. I did and they told me to call customer service. I did that and they said they cant do anything because I need to talk to a gate agent. They gave me the run around and really did not care. Flying home was more mechanical problems. I wound up having to sleep in DTW airport. No hotels available. When I boarded flight DL6121 the agent was slow. I fly for work and will no longer fly Delta. The ground crew and flight crew were all great and concerned for the safety of the passengers. The gate agents lack any general concern for customers safety comfort or well being.
10112,Delta Air Lines,8-Jan-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Flew from LAX to Haneda (12/22/2013) and from Narita to LAX (12/29/2013). Flights were on time in fact earlier than scheduled. Flight attendants were very courteous not typical of attendants of United States airlines. The online check in and baggage drop center that takes baggage more than 3 hours before flight time make travel a breeze.
10113,Delta Air Lines,8-Jan-14,USA,5,First Class,3,YES,I flew during the chaos caused by the weather the delays wer understandable. Leaving mass the staff at Logan assisted me with my sick child by being attentive and making us as comfortable as they could. When we stopped in JFK again the staff were very pleasant while we waited 3 hours to board to Dominican Rep. Staff did what they could to keep passengers entertained. On the other hand I feel like customer service stops in the US while in the Dominican Rep I felt like I was dealing with a whole different airline. staff were rude and inconsiderate. Delta needs to take time to train their Dominican staff.
10114,Delta Air Lines,7-Jan-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"I was on this flight which was delayed by over 2 hours in Atlanta and never once were we given the reason for the delay. That's fine. A delay is a delay. Here is where it gets interesting. Once we boarded this old DC plane the cabin crew promptly made an announcement that they had ""forgotten"" to load water to the tanks. So even though the flush would work there would be no water from the faucets to wash our hands. Instead there was just a bottle of water kept in the toilet. Yes that was my Delta experience! I met another traveler in Mexico a few days later who apparently flew the same flight two days later and had the same water issue. This really explains why I should avoid Delta in the future! Absolutely no customer service."
10115,Delta Air Lines,6-Jan-14,Philippines,10,Economy,5,YES,Economy Comfort Manila to Tokyo Narita. The extra $39 is well worth it. Much more peaceful cabin and priority boarding. The extra recline and seat pitch really made a difference. Flight attendants anticipated the needs of passengers. consistently offering snacks and refreshments. they were very courteous and tried to address the concerns of passengers as best they can. I also appreciated the fact that they took the extra effort of addressing me by my name. It was very thoughtful of them.
10116,Delta Air Lines,4-Jan-14,USA,10,Business,4,YES,DL0117 on 12/29/13 STR to ATL on 767-300ER. 1x2x1 config in Delta's premium cabin remains unbeatable service levels w/Delta generally consistent. This flight even surprised on the upside: excellent menu out of STR and a top notch cabin crew. Is it a throw back to times past when an attendant cares to monitor your Scotch remains 'easy ice' i.e. bring an additional ice cube when needed and without being prodded? That was a crew that made it a joy to fly over the Holidays. Delta wins on many levels these days.
10117,Delta Air Lines,3-Jan-14,USA,4,Economy,2,NO,New Orleans to Boston. A blizzard was headed for the Boston area and delays were expected. Was charged $100 because my luggage was 2.3 lbs over weight. I asked a man working at the ticket area to help me transfer to an earlier flight in order to beat the storm. He told me he would put me on standby and directed me toward a gate. Lady at the gate told me I'd have to wait an hour till she could answer any of my questions. Went back to the desk an hour later and told that the man at the check in desk must have made a mistake and that I had not been put on standby. Lady then put me in standby and told me she would call my name if a seat opened up. Everyone began to board the flight and my name had not been called just as they were closing the gate the lady yelled at me to get on the plane. Ran down the ramp. Flight staff were OK landed a little early. Things went much smoother in Atlanta.
10118,Delta Air Lines,2-Jan-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,"Florida to Seattle flights delayed due to weather and would miss connection in Atlanta. Understandable. Ticket agent wanted to send me to Atlanta and sit on standby. Whereby I was not guaranteed a seat and no hotel meal compensation. Had agent book me on flight early next day instead. Booked seat from Florida to Atlanta but no seat booked from Atlanta to Seattle by agent and now on standby. Tried to assign seat over internet but was blocked because agent put me on standby. Called Delta and was informed that the airport agents now had control and could not book a seat. Told telephone agent to let me speak to supervisor as I was looking at 25 empty seats on their website. Agent spoke to supervisor and supervisor assigned me a seat. Now why couldn't other agent have done that hours earlier? Arrived at baggage check-on area (already had boarding passes) for ""red-eye"" return trip from Seattle. Stood in line watching understaffed agents for 20 minutes and was told when we finally got to the front of the line that we had missed the baggage check-in window by 3 minutes. Keep in mind we had already stood in line 20 minutes. Told to go to the Special Services line. Got in Special Services line and stood for 15 minutes. By now not only had my wife and I missed checking our bags but we had now missed the flight. Told by ""red coated"" Supervisor is that all they could do was put us on standby for a 11.25 pm ""red-eye"" flight with no guarantee we could even get on the plane as there were no seats available. As we pointed out how long we stood in their lines the ""red coat"" got surly and told us that this was our only choice. She would not help us with a room or meals. We asked about a trip the next day which she booked us on that left at 11.45 am. Now 13 hours later. When we asked where we could find a hotel she pointed the directions to the hotel board center and basically said we were on our own. The last straw was they lost our baggage on the return flight. Finally came in on the next flight after midnight next day."
10119,Delta Air Lines,30-Dec-13,Germany,3,Business,1,NO,2 hours flight between Atlanta and Nassau. Business class ticket. Very old and noisy aircraft (MD88). Business class seats OK. Sky Priority boarding. Except bananas and bretzel and drinks do not expect any meal served at dinner time even for a 1500 USD ticket. No lounge access for this international destination except if you have the right frequent flyer status. I will avoid to fly them again for this amount of money.
10120,Delta Air Lines,29-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,We made reservations way in advance prepaid our flights and chose the seats that best accommodated our needs. Delta then changed the flights on several occasions and reassigned our seats giving us the worst possible seating even having our kids separate from us. We called customer service and were told they could not do anything that they are not allowed to change other people's seats. That is exactly what they did to us! We learned our lesson the hard way and we hope to never have to fly Delta again.
10121,Delta Air Lines,29-Dec-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I recently took a trip from Huntsville AL to OKC from Nov 21-Dec 27th. I found my first flight to be a very pleasant experience but what impressed me was how my return flight was handled. We were late I was due to depart at 3.30 and by the time I checked in it was 3.21. I was booked on the 6.10 flight right then and there. The staff didn't even charge a fee for having to change my flight.
10122,Delta Air Lines,25-Dec-13,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,To Las Vegas from Jacksonville Florida. The plane we were on from Atlanta to Las Vegas a long flight had no leg room and there were two large men and me in a row! On the way back from Las Vegas we knew right away that our flight was going to miss the connection. I called Delta to try to get a connecting flight worked out and was on hold for around 45 minutes. Never did get it worked out over the phone. When we arrived in Atlanta they told us to go to a kiosk to find out what they had decided to do with us and a series of coupons came out. One for 25.00 of food (everything was closed) and a coupon for a hotel. On the flight back at 8 that morning the plane was packed and it looked like most had had the same kind of night we had. There were three stewardesses in the back of the plane talking so loud it kept waking everyone up. They did not provide a beverage service because of turbulence so they were non stop until I pushed my button and told them they were disturbing everyone. The girl was very rude and we heard her tell the other two we are talking too loud for the wonderful passengers out there! And went right back to their discussion.
10123,Delta Air Lines,23-Dec-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,BOS-AMS-BOS Dec 2013. I don't know when they put the upgraded Airbus 330s into service but it's as good as any business service I've seen on a US carrier. 1-2-1 seating so if you're by the window you're not trapped if the person next to you is in full recline mode. In the usual 2-2-2 format I've always avoided the window but on this service the window seat at 9J worked very well. The seats are on the narrow side for business but you get an individual pod that's narrower in the front (where your feet go) wider in the back; the seats have full recline. Cabin staff on both flights were senior attentive and friendly. On AMS-BOS the genial captain came back before take-off to chat up everyone in business individually. I only used the A/V to track flight progress but the screen is large and pops out of the pod wall. The pillow was comfortable. The amenities kit is about average - the usual socks etc. but nothing special and they don't offer the business amenity that my wife really likes - PJ''s.
10124,Delta Air Lines,23-Dec-13,Czech Republic,5,Economy,2,YES,"A combination of hit and miss but as its my first ""experience"" on a US airline and using the 3 major American legacy carriers Delta seems to have offered the most consistent service level even definitely seriously sub par compared to Asian and European carriers. Flew from Bangkok to Los Angeles through Tokyo Narita. Delta's service in Thailand and Japan far superior than on US soil. BKK-NRT with a B747 the seats were extremely thin. Cannot conceive sitting in such a seat all the way to LAX. From Tokyo Narita a comfortable B777. Flights on time entertainment acceptable with an OK selection of films. Food edible however spartan portions. Flew Delta Connection from Los Angeles to San Francisco with a very comfortable Embraer jet. Not happy about paying for checked in luggage. No other service on board. The return flight was a disappointment. Delta sold me a return routing from Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda and then 19 hours later from Tokyo Narita to Bangkok which I accepted assuming that the airline will assist in the transfer and accommodation. Delta refused to assist in any of the above thus I had to handle my own transfer between the airports as well for own accommodation and food. This is the main reason why I will be adamant in flying to the USA with a non local airline so only on European Asian or Middle Eastern airlines that would offer generally a far higher service levels. The ""comfort plus"" product is a laughable one from Delta. Trying to sell seats with better leg room however seats scattered in the cabin with no better seats dedicated cabin or special menu. So not recommending this wanna-be premium economy. On board staff did their job but surprised of how detached they were from the passengers. Recommended airline but there are a lot of other better options in my experience."
10125,Delta Air Lines,23-Dec-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,"Newark to LA via Minneapolis. I arrived at Newark airport with plenty of time before my flight was due to leave. I was then told via the computer alert system that my flight was one hour delayed. After a one hour delay I was allowed to board the flight. We then proceed to sit on the runway for another hour and as a consequence I missed my connection. Once I landed in Minneapolis I was told (very abruptly and rudely) that I had missed the flight and was told to then search for my new boarding pass in amongst a sea of boarding passes of others who had also missed their flights because handing them out individually would have been too easy and maybe make sense? I then proceeded through the airport to the baggage reclaim and customer information area where I asked the Delta airlines representative whether there was any available food for people who had missed their flights. She told me that if I wanted something to eat I had to order a pizza. Last but not certainly not least when I was finally able to pick up my rucksack from the Delta ""office"" I was wearing a sling due to a shoulder injury. Delta staff in the office watched me struggle to pick up my backpack for around ten minutes before finally I actually had to ask them for help. I must say though through all my complaining I had two okay stewardesses on that flight however the rest of the Delta staff were rude and inconsiderate."
10126,Delta Air Lines,20-Dec-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,"DAL 417 LAX to SYD and DAL 16 from SYD to LAX. Both legs on Delta's 777-200LR in seat 7A. Used kiosk for check-in at both LAX and SYD. The Delta ""business class"" lounge at LAX is nothing more than Delta's normal ""Sky Club"" the facility was overcrowded and like being inside an extremely loud bar. The flights pushed back pretty much on time. Delta's 777-200LR is getting a bit worn looking and the herringbone ""suites"" that face away from the windows (as opposed to the much-better window-facing suites used by carriers like Cathay Pacific) had walls so low that privacy was minimal. I was lucky enough to have seat 7A on both flights; 7A has the advantage of having a closet next to the seat which in effect forms a cave that the seat reclines back into. The set-up is very good for allowing sleep. The flight crews were LA-based both directions seemed to be made up of senior FA's and on balance did a really nice service both directions. The flights featured three meal services - dinner/lunch a mid-flight snack and a light breakfast. The forward and mid galleys had a variety of low end snacks available throughout the flight. The AVOD system is OK (screen sizer and location) but nothing special but it does have available a fairly broad selection of movies. The best part of the flights was my ability to sleep. I am a large guy and I've had real trouble trying to sleep in the flat-bed first and business seats used by British Air Cathay Pacific and Qantas. Delta was a refreshing change. I got 7-8 solid hours of quality sleep time on both flights. Part of the reason is that the FA's move the meal service process along efficiently and get the cabin lights down early into the flight. On arrival although Delta offers BusinessElite passengers a fast-track immigration/customs pass I didn't use them because as a TSA Global Entry cardholder I was able to use the kiosks in both Sydney and LAX. As I only had carryons the total time from plane until I was out of the airport could not have been more than 10 minutes. In the past I've normally flown on Qantas to/from Australia and New Zealand but with Delta's codeshare arrangement with Virgin Australia (an excellent carrier by the way in all respects) and given my outstanding recent experience on Delta's 777 I plan to continue using Delta for my travel to/from Oceania."
10127,Delta Air Lines,20-Dec-13,Philippines,8,Economy,4,YES,"MNL-NRT-JFK (B744/Premium Economy) EWR-ATL(A319/Y) ATL-SNA (B757/Y) SNA-MSP (A319/Y) MSP-EWR (A320/Y) and JFK- NRT-MNL (B744/Y). In general all my flights departed on schedule and on certain occasions even arrived at my destination ahead of schedule. I can safely say that since the last time I flew DL about 2 years ago I noticed a significant improvement in the quality of service. Overall flying experience was very pleasant. Although a lot of the cabin crew are senior I found most to be a lot nicer compared to the grumpy ones in the past. One noticeable improvement was upon boarding. The boarding gate staff are all friendly with special mention to the ones in ATL and JFK T4. They make it a point to greet all passengers by name and with genuine smiles. I was quite impressed by the staff at JFK T4 who took extra time to guide me through the check-in process using the kiosks. They were very helpful and not in a rushed manner. In-flight food on the long-haul flights were decent enough. For the short-haul flights I was able to have as much nuts and pretzels as I want. IFE was pretty good with and easy interface and lots of options to choose from. I thought of trying the premium economy seats and though I'm 6'0"" tall and a little on the heavy side I still didn't find it of much value considering the add-on fee. I really didn't feel much of a difference compared to regular Y. I also found the new seats to be slightly more comfortable and didn't feel as cramped as before. Moreover I've been lucky enough to have entire rows of 3 to myself on most of the flights I took particularly the long-haul ones. It took a bit work checking seat assignments on a regular basis but the effort was well worth. Not only did I get a whole lot of extra space and privacy but extra TV monitors pillow and blankets as well. Much much better than premium economy but at no extra cost. It was an overall pleasant experience flying DL this time."
10128,Delta Air Lines,17-Dec-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,Flew DL7 Dubai to Atlanta. Excellent service from staff. Yes I am short so I fit into the sleeper seat and yes if I were taller it would not be a good fit. Screen on entertainment is adequate. Staff was warm attentive and friendly.
10129,Delta Air Lines,17-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,We left unreasonably early (6 hours ahead) to drop off our rental car and to accommodate the weather. While on route to the airport Delta left a voicemail that our flight was delayed so we would miss our next flight home. He looked up another potential flight and asked if we were able to make it to a flight that should have been boarding as we spoke. So it seemed unlikely that we would make it but it was delayed. So we rush to get to that flight make it to our next stop and are now hours early for our next flight. We head over to Delta and ask if there is any way possible to leave on an earlier flight home because it was not in our plan to be so early and sit at an airport for 5 hours. They could not accommodate us for an inconvenience that was not our fault without an extra charge of one hundred dollars. I'm not satisfied with my service from Delta Airlines to say the least.
10130,Delta Air Lines,16-Dec-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I had to make a last minute trip (same day round-trip) to SFO from LAX on 12/12/2013. I have not flown in economy in years except for Southwest but chose Delta as their price was much lower than Southwest (first class not worth it for this short of flight in my opinion): I booked this trip 10 days in advance. While these flights are branded as Delta they are operated by Compass. I must say that this is an excellent product! My flight to SFO which left at 7.00am left on time and arrived early. In addition a light breakfast snack was served. This flight was half full so I asked for and was given an extra snack to take with me. This kind gesture saved me from having to purchase lunch later. The flight back left SFO at 5.00pm and arrived back on time. This flight was full but the same professional service was received. That being said a snack and drink service helped make a really long day end well. These flights are operated by EMB 175 planes and there are no middle seats only window or aisle. Besides the great price service and on time performance I would recommend this trip as there are assigned seats and clearing security at the Delta terminals in LAX and SFO is much quicker than the Southwest terminals at each airport. I still love Southwest but on this route I have now found a better airline.
10131,Delta Air Lines,16-Dec-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"Boston (BOS) to Atlanta (ATL) to San Francisco (SFO). I was originally supposed to fly from ATL into SJC (San Jose) but was later rebooked Dec 6th�and Dec 7th. I missed my connection because the plane was first over- fuelled then under-fuelled and then there were issues with the ""paperwork."" In Atlanta I was forced to call Delta call center (huge lines to speak with customers representatives on site) to rebook my flight was asked to hold for 30 minutes. When I called again they told me I was holding for no reason because the representative had hung up on my call. My bag is also missing."
10132,Delta Air Lines,16-Dec-13,UK,7,Economy,3,YES,Outward Manchester UK to Miami via Atlanta 5/12/13 and return from Fort Lauderdale 12/12/13. Flight booked in May for a 13/12 return. One month after booking the return ATL-MAN was cancelled by Delta. Automatically rebooked on a flight for the following day. Delta refused point blank to compensate for the inconvenience and extra nights accommodation. As such we chose to fly back a day earlier then our original plans. My request for compensation was a free upgrade from economy to economy plus on the return Atlantic flight. Simply had the terms and conditions quoted to me. Online check in is a joke. Had seats allocated together on each flight but on clicking the change seat option you will find all other seats marked as unavailable. Options were available to upgrade however at a cost. Our expectations for the flight were therefore low on boarding. However both pleasantly surprised with the flight and service. Transatlantic flight on a B767-300 which featured personal seat back TVs. Good choice although the music channels were a little mainstream for my preference. Food more than OK. Plenty of soft drinks offered and alcohol with the main meal. The return flight was on an older model and featured overhead TVs which didn't matter too much as it was an overnight flight and a good hour shorter in travel time than outward. Both internal flights on a B757-200 were adequate. Seat pitch for all four flights was fine typical of an economy flight. Professional cabin crew on all sectors flown. Touch of humour with the Christmas 2013 flight safety video - certainly kept you watching it. All four flights were full in all cabins all had on time departures and arrivals. Apart from the attitude towards a cancelled flight no issues at all with Delta and would certainly fly with them again.
10133,Delta Air Lines,12-Dec-13,USA,8,Economy,3,YES,ATL-JFK Thanksgiving week. Despite Diamond status I was with 2 family members so no upgrade O/B but still managed Economy comfort. Pretty good for 2 hour flight although no IFE. As it was thanksgiving I expected the worst but flight took off on time and landed early. On the return all 3 managed to get upgraded to first. Again pretty good for Thanksgiving Sunday. Landed on time bags already on belt by the time we hauled ourselves from E terminal to bag claim. Overall not bad apart from the price ($500 r/t each) but again it was thanksgiving!
10134,Delta Air Lines,10-Dec-13,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now.
10135,Delta Air Lines,9-Dec-13,USA,8,Economy,3,YES,ONT-SLC-CDG-AMS-MME on 2-3 December (some of the flights were on AF and KL metal but it was a Delta ticket with DL flight numbers for all the segments). An unremarkable and hassle-free journey: all flights were on time the vegan meal I requested for the transatlantic leg was there and both I and my suitcase made it successfully through three quite tight connections (though if I hadn't been able to use the Priority lane at CDG as a result of being a Flying Blue gold I don't think I'd have made that one). Delta's refurbished 767-300ERs are a vast improvement on the previous cabin - they're now even nicer than the ex-Northwest A330s. The legroom in economy comfort is such that at 201cm tall I didn't feel cramped at all and the reading light actually lets you read without eyestrain. My only beef here is that the IFE was virtually unviewable because of the constant stream of PA announcements throughout the flight that kept pausing it. After an hour of trying to watch a movie I'd only seen about 20 minutes of actual footage and when someone came on the PA yet again to tell me in French that Delta extends a special welcome to Skyteam partners etc. I gave up and read a book.
10136,Delta Air Lines,6-Dec-13,USA,9,Premium,5,YES,I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta.
10137,Delta Air Lines,4-Dec-13,USA,8,First Class,5,YES,ATL-LGA-ATL first class. Very motivated crew on both flights who seemed genuinely concerned about the well-being of the passengers. Catering was adequate for a 2-hour flight although the meal uploaded in Atlanta was of better quality than the one served on the return. Return flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to mechanical issues but the crew handled it well and tried to assist passengers with connections. Seats somewhat cramped and no IFE on the A320 and A319 I flew on but I was favorably impressed with the crew.
10138,Delta Air Lines,3-Dec-13,USA,7,Business,5,YES,DL 80/81 ATL-BRU-ATL. Spent a lot of money to fly in Business Elite. Seats comfortable (lay flat) and entertainment system has an amazing selection of options. Food however was so salty and so processed that it was pretty much inedible. Crews on both flights were quite senior and offered good levels of service being most accommodating. However they all lacked a sense of warmth and welcoming. I am a big fan of Delta Air Lines but these flights were somewhat disappointing primarily due to the poor quality of food and beverage provided in both directions.
10139,Delta Air Lines,2-Dec-13,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,Everything was fine however My fianc� and I booked together and were seated separately and they wouldn't do anything to try to get us to be close this is something that many people had complaints and passengers would switch seats to be with their loved ones. They also made us check a bag. Very unhappy about having to check that bag (which was smaller than the other bags that made it on and persons that got on after us also didn't have to check their bags). I don't recommend traveling with them. I just wish that they would have sat us next to each other it makes no sense that they didn't.
10140,Delta Air Lines,2-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"It's been about a month now since my trip from Milan Italy to Las Vegas NV. I flew from Milan to JFK (New York). We waited 4 hours for our connecting flight from New York to Las Vegas. I was assigned a boarding pass and a seat number (24C & 24D) at Terminal 4 gate B25. When I arrived to board the plane at the gate the rudest workers at Delta claimed they didn't see me on the system. When I ask how could this be the Delta representative kept saying ""I don't know"" very condescendingly. An hour before they announced that they needed 2 volunteers to stay overnight for a next flight because they overbooked. Delta forced us to stay at JFK while letting 2 other people take our seats on the flight that we booked over a month prior. We flew all the way from Milan to JFK how were they unable to see us on the system? How were we able to get the boarding passes in the first place if we weren't in the system? The people at the service desk kept giving us attitude and saying to us that they don't see our names on the system. I was so disappointed with my flight experience."
10141,Delta Air Lines,2-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,I booked our Delta flight in May 2013 for 5 family members going to Jamaica Saturday Nov. 23 and returning Saturday Nov.30. We had three changes to our itinerary the last one was in Oct. The flight from Atlanta to Montego Bay was awful. We set in the very back 2 rows of the plane not together but in 2 different rows. We had no windows. On the way back it was the same way. We had our 6 year old granddaughter with us that could see nothing on her first time flying. I'm a Gold SkyMiles Member.
10142,Delta Air Lines,29-Nov-13,USA,7,Economy,5,YES,SFO-ATL-LIM return in regular economy. I got a great deal from SFO to LIM. My overall experience was good. Service on the domestic legs was better than expected with friendly crews and regular drink runs. The crew also responded to the flight attendant button rather promptly. The weak point was the flight from ATL to LIM which was an older plane without personal IFE. However the LIM-ATL flight was on a more modern plane with IFE and plenty of movie choices all free of charge. Food was ok not great but edible and of sufficient quantity. No free alcohol even on international flights to/from LIM. Transfer in ATL was easy with airline representatives at the gate to assist passengers in the transfer process. Would recommend especially if one can get a good deal.
10143,Delta Air Lines,29-Nov-13,UK,10,Economy,4,YES,I traveled from Charlotte NC to Milwaukee WI and my connection in Detroit was a bit late and there was not time to transfer my suitcases. They did not arrive in baggage claim. But they delivered them 2 hours away in Madison WI on the same day and it was Thanksgiving Day.
10144,Delta Air Lines,29-Nov-13,Ireland,9,Economy,5,YES,Flew to New York from Dublin with 2 small kids Fri 22 Nov and returned Mon 25. I must say I was very impressed. The cabin crew were pleasant and professional. The plane was full and they were kept busy but they really made my daughters feel special giving them extra cookies drinks passing chat etc. Even when one woman decided to go to the restroom a few seconds before takeoff - a potentially serious situation - they were firm but polite as they leaped down the aisle to make her sit down. IFE worked on all seats and while a couple of inches of extra legroom wouldn't have gone amiss it was fine for a six hour flight. A word about the meals. I've noticed many times that the catering supplied by European companies (ie going out) is far superior to what you get coming back from the USA regardless of airline. But that's the only criticism really. Well done Delta. In my experience you're at least as good as BA KLM and Virgin.
10145,Delta Air Lines,28-Nov-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,We flew from Manchester UK to Tampa and as Delta gold members we were upgraded to business and first class due to coach being full. It was a great flight great crew and food 3 days later flew from Tampa to Texas Hobby via ATL in coach. The flights were again great snacks and drinks really good service. I feel if you are nice with their staff they are nice back.
10146,Delta Air Lines,27-Nov-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"I booked a first class ticket using miles about a month ago. The only reason I booked the particular flight (red eye) was because of the 1st class seat options. At that time there were a considerable number of 1st class seats open. I checked in via mobile 24 hours before-no issues. Got through security-still no issues. When I went to board the plane I was told when they scanned my boarding pass that I'd been downgraded to Economy (not even Economy Comfort) because I was on a complimentary upgrade. I explained that absolutely was not the case and that I'd specifically booked the flight as a 1st class ticket. The response I received at that point was that ""Corporate did it because of an equipment change we don't know the criteria they used and we can't change it."" I took it up to the most senior person I could at the gate and got the same generic answer. I used to be a huge proponent of Delta and have defended them countless times to friends. I will never fly with them again."
10147,Delta Air Lines,20-Nov-13,Netherlands,5,Economy,3,NO,Good on time performance. Wished to have a second warm meal on board an intercontinental flight then just a breakfast. Very noisy cabin due insulation on the 737. Crew seemed unorganized and hasty. IFE wasn't working properly.
10148,Delta Air Lines,20-Nov-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,Early November BE flight JFK-CDG. Clean aircraft competent FA adequate catering but the Delta lounge at T4 is a disgrace. The complimentary wines are not listed anywhere while the charged offerings are both printed and on electronic pads. Salty snacks only or purchase food. Have they visited their partner Virgin Atlantic's BC lounge? On time arrival and good baggage delivery. Very limited movies on this flight.
10149,Delta Air Lines,20-Nov-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,On time departure despite chaotic boarding in BE due to a seat configuration change. FA were quite senior and not well groomed especially the purser whose uniform was stained. The FA's were very active with service however. Catering good especially the pre arrival hamburger. Lots of videos although every time there was an announcement (and they seem to make many) my movie reverted to the French language. (CDG-EWR). Pre departure lounge was Air France which was offering a buffet lunch along with many wines champagne and snacks.
10150,Delta Air Lines,20-Nov-13,Sri Lanka,1,Premium,3,NO,My wife and I flew back to London Heathrow on flight 19 from Detroit. This airline is a disgrace. Very poor food but it was the service from the flight attendants which was particularly bad. They seem to have absolutely no idea of offering a service. Passengers were treated with complete indifference and staff spent most of their time in the galley eating and talking loudly. Never again. Next time I go to Detroit I will fly BA or virgin to NY so that I only need to suffer the short hop from NYC to Detroit. Coincidentally I have a friend who has just taken a flight on Delta from NY to London who also experienced shocking service.
10151,Delta Air Lines,20-Nov-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I have been flying and traveling internationally for over 10 years and after flying Delta for the first time I will not be traveling for a very long time. Aside from the cramped plane I was refused food service on my 13 hour flight by the extremely rude flight attendants until I gave in and purchased food items. The flight itself was the absolute worst 6.5 hours of turbulence triggered my anxiety and when I tried to get my medicine from overhead I was shouted at by the attendants. Deltas entertainment was terrible and needs to be updated there were 2 small TVs in front of easily over 50 people. When the flight was over there was a half hour delay and I had to catch my next connecting flight. I will never fly Delta again.
10152,Delta Air Lines,15-Nov-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My 7 month pregnant wife and I flew from Chicago to Mexico on Nov 7 2013 on Delta flight 8048. According to the Delta representative I spoke with on the phone Delta messed up and rescheduled everyone on this flight to Nov 8 (without telling anyone and even though the Nov 7 flight still flew). When we didn't show up for our Nov 8 flight in Chicago (since we were already in Mexico since Nov 7 and never knew about the Nov 8 flight) our return flight on Nov 10 was cancelled. We arrived to our airport in Mexico on Nov 10 to find out we had no return ticket to Chicago. The Delta representative was so sorry that she gave us a single 25 dollar gift card to split amongst the 2 of us. This is ridiculous. Why should I ever fly Delta ever again?
10153,Delta Air Lines,15-Nov-13,USA,6,Economy,3,YES,I flew from Chicago to Atlanta. The plane was full the staff very nice and friendly. My only complaint: the cabin was filthy it needed attention and the seats were small I'm a big guy 6 ft and 220 lbs. The flight was a short one if it had been longer it would have been uncomfortable.
10154,Delta Air Lines,13-Nov-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Worst airline to fly on if you are in the military traveling on orders. First who in the military travels with one bag that's right we don't we normaly have a few bags and one normaly weighs between 50 to 100 lbs. So why is it that all the other carriers let the military check one bag up to 100lbs no we are not getting over this is the bag that we transport our gear in. The gear that we use to take the fight to the enemy. Come on Delta get with the program and stop trying to make an extra buck off the military. I guess that's why the military generally uses American Airlines first and Delta only as a last resort. The flight only had a few people on board and when some of them asked if they could move to a vacant seat they were told no.
10155,Delta Air Lines,13-Nov-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Manchester - Atlanta - San Diego. Plenty of snacks and drinks served. Lunch was good and enjoyable. Good selection of films television and music staff were pleasant and efficient. Temperature of cabin was just right. A very positive experience.
10156,Delta Air Lines,10-Nov-13,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,SEA-AMS-SEA. This last transatlantic with Delta will be my very last. I cannot believe KLM/Air France have partnered with Delta and I'm afraid I'm unlikely to continue patronising that group unless I'm sure I'm not flying on a Delta staffed plane. The service was just appalling. The seats in economy were very poor. The underseat space was cramped by some electrical equipment and also very hot as a result. The in-flight entertainment system was not functioning in my seat or any other seat in our row. The only element of the flight that was any good was the lounge in Seattle which had some space to work and attentive staff.
10157,Delta Air Lines,10-Nov-13,Singapore,3,Business,3,NO,BusinessElite SIN-NRT-HNL. Choose Delta only because it offered completely flat beds. B777-200LR flying from SIN-NRT- SIN offers ample legroom when in full recline. However the 767-300 planes NRT-HNL-NRT falls short for anyone over 6&#8217;. In full bed mode the &#8216;seat&#8217; tucks into the narrow space of the seat in front of you. My main gripe was the cleanliness of the cabin. Dirtiest Business Class I've ever flown! Cabin Staff were ok not overly friendly. Pales to any Asian flight crew.
10158,Delta Air Lines,10-Nov-13,USA,3,First Class,1,NO,"My Husband and I booked First Class. Our plane was finally determined as ""Delayed for Catering"" for 4 hours. We missed our connection of course. Originally we were told it was due to weather. There were no other flights to get us home according to the agent in Salt Lake City who said ""I don't have time to help you go over there to the phone bank"". With no flight no luggage and no help we paid for a hotel room had to by clothes meals and I hoped our underwear would dry I washed it in the sink for the next days flight. We had purposely reserved seats together I have a great deal of flight anxiety. Our rescheduled flights separated us and I cried most of the way home. It's not that we are any better than others but we paid a lot of money for our trip on Delta First Class. We bought the special tickets expecting special service. I'm disturbed with the airlines performance and regard for passengers. I guess we paid for only a larger seat."
10159,Delta Air Lines,6-Nov-13,USA,10,First Class,4,YES,When my wife and I travel we usually travel with Delta or Alaska. We always travel first class and so cannot comment on how things are in coach however we have never been disappointed with Delta traveling first class. They always treat us well from check-in to in-flight. The planes are always clean and the staff is incredibly attentive. Unlike Alaska they never skimp on the amenities. They serve full size meals and are constantly checking to see if there is anything else they can do to accommodate you.
10160,Delta Air Lines,4-Nov-13,UK,9,Economy,5,YES,I have to say that whilst everyone likes to moan about airlines my recent flight with Delta was great on their services from/to LHR-JFK. The food was also excellent on the outward flight being a vegetarian I requested a special meal and was served minted peas with wild rice and marinated tofu along with a bread roll cheese and crackers and a dessert. Then just before landing we were served Calzone. They certainly don't let you go hungry! On the return journey however the main dish was pasted and vegetables which wasn't to my liking at all but it was a late night flight and I wasn't particularly hungry anyway breakfast then consisted of a cereal bar and a banana. The only gripes I have are that the leg room is cramped - but where isn't it these days! With regard to the on board entertainment whilst having an excellent selection of content was somewhat slow and sluggish and even required re-starting on the return flight. On the ground baggage arrived promptly and check in was also efficient at both airports with staff being courteous and professional. Both flights left before the scheduled departure time and arrived well before their scheduled arrival time in both cases even though on the outward flight there was a delay in passengers boarding. For the price it was truly excellent.
10161,Delta Air Lines,4-Nov-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Just flew from BWI to Melbourne FL. Worst flights I have ever had. Both flights were overbooked. The staff were asking for volunteers to take a later flight. The staff were confused and had no idea on what they were doing. They were rude and didn't know their jobs very well. This was both trips with connecting flights in Atlanta both ways. Never will I fly Delta again. One of the staff was standing at the desk telling customers she was nobody and couldn't help anyone. Now that is customer service from Delta Airlines.
10162,Delta Air Lines,31-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,My husband and I took a vacation back to the Midwest. We flew Delta from LAX to Minneapolis to Milwaukee with the reverse for the return flights. I was really dreading this - I have MS and knew I would be using a wheelchair. Everything was great! Flights were on time and the pilot and crew were so kind friendly and helpful. My husband and I are tall and we were pleasantly surprised to have ample leg room. Also Delta did a great job with the video on pre-flight safety notes. No one seems to listen to the actual stewards and stewardesses when it comes to this but the video had everyone's attention in this digital age. I definitely recommend flying Delta.
10163,Delta Air Lines,29-Oct-13,Australia,8,First Class,4,YES,SFO to SLC and SLC to LAX in First. Old Airbus 320 on first leg. Interesting no life vests on board just the 'buoyant' seat cushion. Newish 737-800 on leg to LAX. Excellent service and attention from Hawaiian based crew best of any American airline I have traveled on. Both flights on time check in very quick and luggage appeared rapidly. Would recommend.
10164,Delta Air Lines,28-Oct-13,France,6,Economy,3,YES,I flew from Toronto to Atlanta Atlanta to Cancun and Cancun to Atlanta. The seats were very comfy with a good recline especially between Atlanta and Cancun. Crew was very polite but the food choice was very poor. My flight between Toronto and Atlanta was the worst. It was operated by express jet on the behalf of Delta Airlines: poor food was served and the crew wasn't helpful at all. The seats were very hard. Definitely a bad flight. I recommend to fly with Delta airlines despite all but avoid to fly with it subsidiary express jet.
10165,Delta Air Lines,28-Oct-13,France,9,Economy,5,YES,SFO-LAX LAX-KOA KOA-LAX LAX-SEA SEA-CDG. Very nice experience (again) with Delta. I love Delta upgrade policies on internal flights everything is clear and fair you know at any time why you have been upgraded or not. All flights on time cabin crew smiling all the time and very professional. Very nice food. Twice upgraded with my ElitePlus status. Delta Economy comfort seats really worth.
10166,Delta Air Lines,23-Oct-13,Canada,7,Economy,4,YES,"On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way."
10167,Delta Air Lines,23-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,Oct 17th Manchester NH to La Guardia NY flight 6269. Then missed flight 1875 La Guardia NY to Tampa Fl. Just recently flew Delta delayed in taking off then was in a holding pattern due to air traffic and missed connecting flight due to this. Wasn't able to get another flight for 8 hours or so. Will not fly Delta again.
10168,Delta Air Lines,21-Oct-13,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,"In my opinion Delta airline is the worst I have experienced. I am silver and this is the end of my Delta loyalty. I attempted to hop on an earlier flight several times because I had completed my work in Greensboro early. The lady eagerly said "" are you Gold or Platinum""? I said ""no I am Silver."" She stated it would be 50 dollars to go on standby but she is not going to bother because I am silver. With that I was dismissed with a ""Next"". This is not the first time this has occurred and I travel for business. For validity sake my flight number originally prior to attempting an earlier flight was DL1384 from GSO to ATL."
10169,Delta Air Lines,21-Oct-13,UK,3,Economy,3,NO,Took 4 Delta flights 11/10/13 London - Minneapolis - Las Vegas 15/10/13 Las Vegas - Atlanta - London. First time experiencing flying with Delta and it was very disappointing. Like previous comments booked ticket through KLM/Air France where we have always receive a brilliant service. Wondering why they have partnered with Delta to lower their standards. Flight from London to Minneapolis ever so rude cabin crew. Nobody at the entrance to welcome the passengers and direct them to their seats. Not a single smile and very abrupt cabin crew members. The only good thing was they had a good selection of entertainment at least it kept our mind away from their rudeness. Food selection was average. Flight from Minneapolis - Las Vegas more friendly crew and drinks were offered regularly and adequately which made us really surprise for a domestic flight compared to the opposite for the international flight. On our way back at the airport in Las Vegas when checking in again not a single smile from the ground crew or any welcome. Flight from Las Vegas - Atlanta was fine and crew friendly and adequate snacks and drinks served. International flight from Atlanta - London we were welcome this time at the entrance and were directed to our seat. An unpleasant surprise was waiting for me as soon as I popped down the seat tray in front of me to read. Yes it was messy with food stain and dry sauce on it from the previous flight and has not been clean which put me off eating. I requested it to be cleaned which was done pretty much straight away but no apologies whatsoever from the cabin crew. What was more intriguing was the contrast of service between the domestic and the international flights. Will not recommend it to any friends or family.
10170,Delta Air Lines,21-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,Flight DL241 from Rome to Atlanta. Great flight and service from stewards. We even couldn't fill the 11 hour flight. Great attitude and always busy.
10171,Delta Air Lines,21-Oct-13,UK,2,Economy,3,NO,Poor customer service. Sold my seat to someone who was on standby in a complete and utter shambles mix up. Had to ask people to leave the plane for compensation. Poor attitude of staff not helpful at all no empathy for customers situations. Poor service on flights entertainment not working and having to reboot seems to be a daily problem. Planes were dirty and tired. Food was average breakfast dire scrambled egg in a soggy roll after an 8 hour flight. Why not keep it simple with a croissant or pastry or muffin? Wouldn't fly again if I had the choice.
10172,Delta Air Lines,17-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"My disabled husband few up to PA from Dallas. His flight up was delayed in Atlanta because the plane he was supposed to fly out on lost its navigation system and they had to find another. That was bad enough but on his way home he left Harrisburg and flew into Detroit when he got off the plane he asked for a wheelchair and help getting to the gate where his connecting flight was departing and was told ""Just go that way and turn left and you will get to the gate."" He got no help so missed his flight to DFW because he was not able to hurry. He was re- ticketed and had to fly into Atlanta before he could return to Texas. On the flight from Atlanta to DFW he was assigned a seat in the back. I was told it was my fault that my husband couldn't get a wheelchair because I didn't book his flight as a disabled passenger! Like I said before this is not the first time we have had issues with Delta but it will be the last!"
10173,Delta Air Lines,16-Oct-13,UK,2,Economy,1,NO,JFK to LHR leaving 9.10pm 12th Oct. Delta 0005. Have just returned from NY to London and can only agree with the negative reviews. The most rude cabin staff I have ever experienced. We actually got our tickets through Air France and I noticed that another partner was Virgin an airline I use frequently to go to Tokyo with and rate highly. What on Earth are these decent airlines partnering with this outfit for? Food was also terrible and complimentary drink service a joke. The public address system didn't work I see others have commented the same why can't they fix simple things like that? They must know it doesn't work the staff get angry when you ask them to repeat things. A bad end to an otherwise superb visit to the Big Apple.
10174,Delta Air Lines,14-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,Flew Delta Connection (ExpressJet) from Gainesville Florida to Atlanta. Flight was on time and actually arrived ahead of schedule. ExpressJet (DBA Delta Connection) much better than when ASA flew this route as Delta Connection.
10175,Delta Air Lines,14-Oct-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Took 4 Delta flights over the summer Amsterdam-Boston Boston-Atlanta Atlanta-Chicago and Boston-Amsterdam on each of the flights the cabin crew were very friendly and attentive (especially the Atlanta-Chicago flight) were relaxed and seemed to enjoy their job. Seats on all flights were very comfortable and the inflight entertainment on the two international segments was very comprehensive. Plenty of legroom too. Full meal service and hot towels were provided on the international segments which was much appreciated. Domestically Free drinks and snacks were offered which is really all that was required for these flights. I will recommend Delta to my friends and family and look forward to flying with them again along with their partner KLM they offer an excellent route network.
10176,Delta Air Lines,11-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I booked a flight from Denver Colorado to Rochester NY with a connecting flight in LaGuardia. I booked the flight for my grandfathers funeral that was the next morning. The flight was delayed so I was unable to make my connecting flight. Instead they put me on a flight to Salt Lake City Utah to go to Atlanta Georgia to go to Rochester NY. It took over 20 hours to get from Denver to Rochester there was no compassion for my situation by the Delta airline staff. Horrible customer service. I will never fly Delta again.
10177,Delta Air Lines,11-Oct-13,Australia,10,Economy,5,YES,with a group of 86 flying DL16 and 17 SYD-LAX return Sept/Oct 2013. this is the second large group experience on this route with Delta the last being four years ago. As in the last I have nothing but praise for Delta. Check- ins with lots of excess/oversized luggage were most efficient and very quick indeed. The ground staff at both terminals were polite well trained and accommodating. The self check-in computers in LAX were very intuitive and easy to use. Both flights were on time. Inflight service was excellent. Flying the return route in the back of economy I noted how little wait there was for meals after the service had started. Again the service was not only quick but accommodating and compared very well to Singapore; my personal benchmark. The food was fine for economy class airline fare. The entertainment options were comprehensive. Perhaps the airline could upgrade its earphones a little. Seating was comfortable. The Comfort Economy which I used on the outward bound trip was well and truly worth the money. Most importantly Delta has its own terminal at LAX; meaning you avoid the general admissions hall. This is an excellent reason in itself to choose the airline on the SYD-LAX route.
10178,Delta Air Lines,10-Oct-13,South Africa,0,Economy,1,NO,"I regularly travel between South Africa and the USA always on South African Airways (SAA). I have just travelled on Delta from South Africa to Atlanta. Both the ground staff and cabin staff were appalling. Gives rudeness a whole new meaning. Do Delta train staff to be so rude or is this a criterion for selection to Delta staff. We were offered no headphones. After 45 mins of attempting to get the cabin crew attention we were finally given a broken set of earphones. We again had great difficulty in getting their attention in getting another set. There was no choice of wines. Just a glass of box wine. We asked for a large bottle of water as my colleague and I drink a great deal en route. We were told that this is not allowed! We were assured that cabin crew would pace the plane with offers of drinks all night. Not only was this absolutely not the case but again it was virtually possible to get their attention at any stage of the night. The supper was moderate. The ""breakfast"" was probably the worst meal I have had on a flight ever. It was accompanied by a literally frozen salad so one had to chomp the ice off. SAA offers seats in the emergency exit at no charge. Delta uses this as another opportunity to rip off customers. Delta staff do yourselves a favour and travel on SAA to find out how to offer a high lass service."
10179,Delta Air Lines,10-Oct-13,China,10,Economy,5,YES,29th Sep from Shanghai to Tokyo on DL296 and from Tokyo to Shanghai by DL295 on 5th Oct. I took the flight to and fro from Shanghai to Tokyo. it was a nice experience. The safety presentation that they provide is really unique. Food Quality was also excellent. Staff was very polite inside the airline but Staff at Tokyo Airport Check-In counters were rude and unfriendly and I hope Delta can do something about it as it spoils the image of the airline. The flights were on time and my kids really enjoyed the in-flight entertainment.
10180,Delta Air Lines,8-Oct-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,My wife and I recently traveled for business out of 4 flights 2 of the departing flights were late the second causing us to miss our connecting flight that left early. The flight was scheduled for 12.05 and we were standing at the gate at 12.03 the plane was already gone after we rushed off the plane and across Atlanta airport because this being a Delta hub they can't have planes in the same concourse. We go to the counter and are told they moved us to a different flight without telling us because we weren't going to make our original flight. So they are delaying us 2 hours because they couldn't leave on time for a 8.25 first flight. I politely asked if we could wait in the Delta sky club and was rudely told that it costs 50.00 to use the sky club. I will make sure I will not fly Delta again.
10181,Delta Air Lines,8-Oct-13,USA,3,Economy,4,NO,October 6 from LAX to ATL-Flight started out fine nothing really to complain about. The stewards were average somewhat snooty. Had a good selection of entertainment. Regular snacks on the plain (peanuts pretzels cookies). The end of the flight was extremely rough due to rain but the captain gave some reassurance. Then we landed with only minutes until our next connecting flight to MGM. This is where our trip took a nasty turn. We arrived at the gate with 20 minutes to spare (our flight was to take off at 8.55) but our flight was delayed 5 minutes so we had some breathing room. Then our flight got delayed another 20 minutes then another hour then at 11.45 (sitting in the terminal for over two hours) they cancelled it. We got a rental car that we could have had two hours ago and been home by now.
10182,Delta Air Lines,7-Oct-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,6 sectors with Delta in last 3 month. Winnipeg-Minneapolis-Amsterdam on July 10th Amsterdam-Minneapolis-Winnipeg on August 19th then Winnipeg-MSP-LaGuardia on August 27th. All flights except one on time great service provided by cabin crew. On long haul flights hot towels were offered which is very nice touch. Great food and beverages. Bags delivered promptly on arrival. Delta prices and customer service is definitely competitive. Will fly with them again!
10183,Delta Air Lines,3-Oct-13,UK,9,Economy,5,YES,Man to SFO via Atlanta. New York to Manchester via Atlanta. Both Manchester flights on A330 very comfortable seating is 2x4x2 with each seat having its own inflight entertainment. Other sectors on A319/b737. Service on all the flights was excellent very friendly staff. A lot better than American. Reserved seats together on all flights when booking saved a lot of problems at check in. Transfer in Atlanta was quick and efficient well within 90 minutes suggested. Flights were a good deal.
10184,Delta Air Lines,30-Sep-13,USA,8,Premium,4,YES,AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1.� In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.
10185,Delta Air Lines,30-Sep-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,LHR-JFK-LAX-LHR (via Detroit). I purchased the tickets for almost �300 cheaper then the British Airways / Virgin Atlantic equivalent - and it was money well saved! To JFK had great pitch in 767 economy great food drink and snacks and the on demand touch screen entertainment meant the flight went really quick. All the internal flights were on 757s and they were as equally as good and all had touch screen on demand entertainment which I wasn't expecting. It's right to say that American airlines have a bad reputation but my perception has changed and when I come back to the USA next year I will fly delta. The product is on par if not better then the other airlines and would recommend them.
10186,Delta Air Lines,30-Sep-13,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,I have been a gold member for at least one year. I usually fly every 4 to 6 weeks from DCA to Lagos Nigeria. The food service is extremely poor. Breakfast is disappointing I have now learnt to eat before flying. The airline assumes everyone can eat the cheesy bread served in the AM the rice has practically no taste and the bathrooms are in such a bad state before we land. I have only been upgraded twice on the economy flights. I ask each time and the response is the same 'you may or may not be upgraded and you will be told at the gate'. I flew Air France on the trip before last and even got upgraded on that flight to economy comfort. Delta really does need to appreciate their gold members. I fly delta because of convenience but I'm beginning to think it may not be worth it. Bad food with no absolutely no fringe benefits is quite frustrating especially when other airlines offer much more. To fly long distance every 4 to 6 weeks with no benefits are not worth it.
10187,Delta Air Lines,27-Sep-13,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Whatever happened to schedule integrity? We booked our vacation to St. Martin on Delta because no overnight flights were required. Then they changed their schedule and now we have to overnight in Detroit on the way home. They will do nothing about this inconvenience and expense.
10188,Delta Air Lines,26-Sep-13,USA,10,Business,4,YES,LAX-JFK DL1762 Sep 19 JFK-SEA DL 161 Sep 22. Business elite 767. Excellent experience especially for domestic service. Truly international service with lie flat seats duvets and quite good food. Service was efficient and warm. Would definitely choose this again over most other carriers on these routes.
10189,Delta Air Lines,26-Sep-13,Italy,2,Economy,1,NO,Seattle (SeaTac) - Paris (CDG): 23 September. Flight was horrible! Low Seat comfort and low quality food. But the worst thing is seat assignment: my girlfriend was behind me and that's how it was for a lot of couples and friends! It's obvious that this is done on purpose in order to earn money from change seat utility during the check-in online.
10190,Delta Air Lines,25-Sep-13,UK,5,Economy,4,YES,On both outbound (Atlanta) and inbound (Manchester) the controller in my seat did not work (same fault L/R control not working) fortunately my wife was not using hers so changed seats. Really annoying on longer flights. Service good legroom as ever poor. Atlanta airport terminal improved beyond all measure actually pleasurable experience after zoo on previous occasions.
10191,Delta Air Lines,23-Sep-13,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,I had flown to SFO from LHR trip with Air France which was fantastic. My return flight with Delta was anything but. SFO-ATL then to LHR. Flight to ATL was really bad. The seats were uncomfortable and old. The cabin crew were average at the best of times. There was no food unless you wanted to pay $10 for a box of candy and potato chips. The inflight entertainment was terrible - there were about 3 free things to watch - everything else had to paid for. After already paying a lot of money for a flight airlines then try and nickel and dime you for things like entertainment and food. Next was ATL-LHR. This was no better. Seats were uncomfortable and cramped. I'm only 5'2 and even I was uncomfortable. Entertainment was not great although a step up from the last. The fact that there was no personal controller really irritated me. When the screen is unresponsive the last thing I want to do on a long flight is have my arm up constantly hitting the screen just to get something to work. The cabin crew again were just average. The food was pretty bad and bland. The PA announcements were hard to hear and were of terrible quality. Overall it was a terrible experience. The only good thing about the flight was their safety/welcome video! This was actually well thought out and funny - I actually took notice of it and watched the whole thing on both flights. Too bad they don't put that much thought and effort in to the actual flying part.
10192,Delta Air Lines,25-Sep-13,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,My daughter 9yrs travelled alone from Delhi to Minneapolis under Unaccompanied Minor Program. Starting at Delhi airport there was an official with my daughter's name placard he took my daughter along with the paper work and helped my family with baggage. The official at Delhi handed her to the crew in Delta office. They made her comfortable and let her sleep. The flight attendants were always keeping a keen eye on her and ready to assist her. She had a break in Netherlands where the crew guided her towards skyzone play place with snacks toys books and TV. The flight was a bit late - about 20 minutes but the special services desk advised us that the immigration might take a while longer for her to come out. I feel my experience will help some one in need of the similar situation.
10193,Delta Air Lines,25-Sep-13,UK,10,Business,5,YES,Our family flew in August Manchester to Atlanta on to Vegas. We had a flight time change on first flight so Delta placed us on later flight to Vegas but upgraded all to 1st. On arrival at Manchester airport we knew the flight was slightly overbooked so they upgraded 4 of us to business class for no extra Flight and food service was excellent we are all medallion members and I feel it pays to be loyal to one airline if possible.
10194,Delta Air Lines,25-Sep-13,USA,8,Economy,3,YES,We were scheduled to fly LaGuardia NY to Nashville TN 11.30 am. At 11.15 our flight was cancelled. We were an 8 person group flying for a birthday celebration. Delta got us on a 6.45 flight. With hours of standing around I approached someone in the Delta lounge. Because none of us were members we were not allowed to remain there but the woman who helped us was remarkable! She got all 8 of us our luggage ground transportation to JFK and on a 3.30 Delta flight. She also made sure we didn't have to pay for our luggage a second tine.
10195,Delta Air Lines,23-Sep-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"Flew from Paris to Minneapolis - economy. Seat comfort and room absolutely atrocious. We were having center seats (wife and I) on row 29. Not only did my knees bump against the seat in front of me but to make matters worse there was no room below the front seat because of a metal box mounted on the floor. We could not even stretch our legs under the front seat. I checked other rows and it seemed that row 29 was the only row that had this condition (Airbus 330). I am 6'1"" tall and my wife is 5'10"" - so we both got periodic leg cramps. The movie/entertainment system did not work at all - a total farce. Staff was friendly enough but did not care about the problems with the entertainment system. Food was reasonable - because it was prepared in Paris - much better quality than when we flew from LA to Paris. Although that flight was on a 777 - had much better leg room and were able to stretch fully - but that was an Air France flight (tail had Air France marking and not a Delta derivative like coming back). Also on this flight the service and in flight entertainment system was superior - the choice of movies absolutely incredible. So - My advice is when you fly Delta make SURE you are on an original Air France flight AND 777 and not an Air France Delta derivative flying these lousy tiny Airbuses 330."
10196,Delta Air Lines,23-Sep-13,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,I flew from Atlanta to Amsterdam and back. Outbound I don't remember anything being wrong flight was ok. But when I flew back? It was the worst flight I've had and I fly a lot. Food: They had only some egg omelette with potatoes and it was disgusting. After 3 beers they wouldn't give me anymore. Flight info didn't work. The light indicating if the toilet was free didn't work on either side of plane. Never again with Delta Airlines.
10197,Delta Air Lines,23-Sep-13,USA,9,First Class,4,YES,ATL-SEA DL1220. Check-in at curb side was excellent in Atlanta. All flight attendants were friendly and professional. Flight left timely. Baggage was waiting for us on arrival. Lunch was good and included a choice of a hot steak sandwich or a salad with chicken. SEA-ATL DL1962. Check-in inside terminal was fast and friendly. Again all flight attendants were friendly and professional. My only complaint was that this flight was on an old 757 with screens on the ceiling to view the movie. Lunch was good and included a choice of a pizza or roast beef salad. In general Delta's flight attendants are much nicer than those at American and United. Delta is a very good airline but has the chance to become an excellent airline.
10198,Delta Air Lines,19-Sep-13,Netherlands,1,Premium,2,NO,"AMS to JFK 14th Sep Flight DL 71. Since my husband is 2 meters tall and suffers from a double hernia I always book him a comfort seat. As I did on his flight yesterday (09/14). The seat however was broken and did not recline at all the inflight entertainment system was broken as well. On telling a crew member about the problem it was laughed away and he was told to ""phone China because that is where the manufacturer is located"". Hoping it was just this one crew member who was so rude he reported the problem to another crew member and lo and behold was given the same answer. So after paying more for some ""comfort"" during this flight he had to sit straight for 8.5 hours with no movie to watch or music to listen to and with a crew that I would not even put to work in a fastfood restaurant. No more Delta for us in future!"
10199,Delta Air Lines,18-Sep-13,Hong Kong,8,Business,4,YES,HKG-NRT return. Delta does an early flight to Tokyo from Hong Kong and an evening flight back which suits people departing from HK wanting to take advantage of the vacation to the max. First time trying this airline and on their Business elite class I must say I was truly impressed. Cabin staff are mostly Asians charming and helpful the American staffs are great too. Herringbone design flat bed seat is comfortable although angled to an odd position where you had to look behind for the window. Good storage space spacious comfortable seat which lies flat good food and beverages served on board. Alcohol is free for business elite customers. Some of the Asian cabin staffs are really helpful and we had great conversations. AVOD is fine nice noise-cancelling headphones are provided. All in all if the price is right (often they are) this is a very good choice for cheap business class experience.
10200,Delta Air Lines,17-Sep-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,How can Delta sell tickets with connecting flights knowing that they don't give you time to get from one plane to the next. I missed my flight thanks to this even though I ran from one gate to the next. I made it to the gate 5 mins before departure only to find the plane was already gone. I was stuck over night because there were no more flights until the next morning. I will never fly them again.
10201,Delta Air Lines,16-Sep-13,UK,7,Economy,3,YES,JFK-Las Vegas return. Both flights arrived ahead of schedule. Good onboard service (although had to pay for drinks and food). 737-800 looking tired with overhead screens. Found out when checking in that needed to pay US$ 25.00 for checked luggage. I didn't know that Delta has gone the No-Frills route. Apart from this it was an ok experience.
10202,Delta Air Lines,14-Sep-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,28 Aug LHR-JFK. Booking and Check In Easy. Hit birds upon takeoff a known problem at LHR captain explained everything as it was happening. Cabin Crew completely reassuring and brought us bottles of water. Captain informed us we were to go back to LHR return took 2 hours dumping fuel getting clearance and immigration. Cabin Crew instructing people on how to rebook and actively handling everyone's connections. Upon arrival professional we were called forward by name we were the only ones without checked baggage. Delta rep met us gave us new boarding passes and whisked us across terminal 4 and onto a plane for ATL in less than 20 minutes in fantastic seats with bulkhead legroom.
10203,Delta Air Lines,14-Sep-13,Switzerland,0,Economy,2,NO,29th July Switzerland to Seattle with a connecting flight in Amsterdam. Short flight was ok but Delta flight to Seattle was the most unpleasant fight I've had. I was with my husband 3 yr daughter and 8 month baby boy. The seating arrangement could not work my husband and daughter where sat in a different cabin while me and my baby in a different one. We had requested to be sat together. I was not given any belt to connect with my baby who was sitting on my lap. After take off the FA said she would bring me a bassinet for my son. To make matters worse they could not provide a bassinet for my son so I had to hold him for 10 hrs. Crew served drinks food and sandwiches I could not open the tray as I had my son on my lap so they ended up putting food on the floor. I asked to be moved they said they could not do that. Am now in Seattle and will be heading back home on Monday with Delta Airlines I don't know how it will be then.
10204,Delta Air Lines,12-Sep-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,We flew out to JNB on DL200 on July 28 2013 and returned on August 28 2013. First and foremost all of the toilets on both aircraft were filthy starting one hour after departure. We have flown on virtually every major European and Asian airline and none have had filthy toilets. We fly literally around the world 1-2 times a year and we were appalled at the lack of cleanliness. Having flown for more than 50 years I can never remember 2 flights like our flights to and from South Africa. My wife and I had to wash the soles of our shoes after rinsing the floor of the lavatory. Never have I had to do that on any other flights. We went to Asia this year on Cathay Pacific Premium Economy and the flight attendants cleaned the lavatories every 30 minutes like clock work. I never saw a Delta flight attendant cleaning the lavatory. Another subject-the so-called headphones are a joke. The top piece of the ear buds came off 5 times on the outbound flight and 6 times on the inbound flight. Why not charge for headphones even in so called Economy Comfort so that they can be used on a 16 hour flight? Lastly the seats were anything but comfortable. Never again.
10205,Delta Air Lines,11-Sep-13,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,"Originally booked (and missed) my 6.40am flight from SFO to LGA (NYC) via MSP in economy. Arrived very late at airport but helpful counter agent confirmed seats (as opposed to standby) via DTW a few hours later for a $50 fee. Very long B757-300 was completely full - but clean and cabin staff attentive and repeated beverage service. Quick layover in Detroit and then a 1hr 15min flight on an Airbus A319 to LGA. Good service again and attentive cabin staff. Plenty of room in exit row #9 (not a Delta Elite) Legroom is seldom a problem at 5'7"" but YMMV. Zero entertainment options but not an expectation as it's just a little over one hour in the air from Detroit to NYC. Seat mate's reading light inop but not a real problem. Decent blue moon beer on each flight for $6. Both flights on time good value and comfort for what is standard experience for domestic economy these days especially as the flights are full. Would recommend."
10206,Delta Air Lines,10-Sep-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew with Virgin from LHR to JFK and that was fine but Delta from JFK to LAX was not an experience I would wish to repeat. Chaotic scenes at gate - staff seemed completely disorganised and service on the plane was very poor too. Staff seemed disinterested in their passengers. We were towards the back of the plane and it was very cold - no blankets available for an overnight flight. When disembarking we saw heaps of unopened packets of blankets down the front. Although there was a range of inflight entertainment audio was so poor we were unable to take advantage of it. The main reason why I will avoid Delta in future is that it is takes so long to get through to speak to someone on their customer service helpline and even then the service is extremely poor.
10207,Delta Air Lines,9-Sep-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,Flew from FAR to RIC and back. It was a great trip. My only complaint is short layover times causing me to have to run through large airports to make the connection. Lesson learned. Now I book flights with longer layovers and less stress. Delta's App for android worked superbly.
10208,Delta Air Lines,6-Sep-13,USA,8,Business,5,YES,PDX-LAX. Evening flight was cancelled due to equipment failure. Delta had me on a connecting SLT flight departing only 15mins later with a 15min connection to LAX. Excellent on the ground service. Best yet is my checked bags waiting in LA. If I had to run to make connections they did an great job to keep my bags with me. Service was good but need to upgrade business product.
10209,Delta Air Lines,5-Sep-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"My flight Delta 7318 was due to depart Rochester NY to LGA yesterday at 6.16pm. Delayed until 7.38pm then 8.51pm then 9.30pm and 10.30pm. Delta Customer Service is everything but helpful. This time I was at least notified in advance that I'd be delayed but once I arrived at the airport there were still continuous delays. Of course I was told the reason for the delays were due to weather but I was also told it was due to air traffic. Once we finally arrived in LGA we sat on the runway for a half an hour due to ""heavy air traffic"". When you are already delayed hours past the time you are due to arrive home the last thing you want to hear is that we are going to sit on the runway for another half an hour. This is beyond acceptable and even more so because it seems to be the only way Delta Airlines conducts itself poorly. This is everything but efficient and conducive to my time."
10210,Delta Air Lines,4-Sep-13,Italy,8,Economy,4,YES,Two different flights: DAL242 CDG-BOS and DAL6055 BWI-RDU-MCO. First operated by a B757 flight was nice nice crew nice seat and a nice IFE. I had been doubtful about the seats in a narrowbody for 7 hours but it was like any other widebody (if not better less people). The meals were good and the crew served drinks and snacks more than one time along the flight. It was a very pleasant flight. Second is operated with an ERJ145 (Chautauqua with DL colors) flight was in time and the crew was again very nice. Only snacks and drinks but in both legs they passed more than one time. Flight in time and the crew gave us information about the stop and the possible transit at MCO. Also this was a great flight.
10211,Delta Air Lines,4-Sep-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Scheduled to connect Delta-to-Delta flights from ATL to FAY on 9/1/13. Delta's flight from Ft. Lauderdale was delayed which in turn caused us to miss our connecting flight. Told to stand in a lengthy line of other disgruntled customers so we could scan our boarding passes to update our flight info. Scheduled for a flight the next day. Back to another lengthy line to try and receive a flight that is at least on the same day. The end of this line is met with a rude and detached individual who proceeds to put us on standby for a flight two hours away. Stand in yet another line and speak with another Delta representative who has no business working in public relations. This scenario would be repeated many times this night. Only to meet with one unsympathetic and belligerent individual after another. Needless to say we were stranded in that airport the entire night. Because the cause of the flight delay was ""weather related "" Delta bears no responsibility to accommodate us in any form. Not even so much as a breakfast biscuit. Will make 10 connecting flights to avoid Delta Airlines in the future."
10212,Delta Air Lines,4-Sep-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Took 45 hours to get back from Orlando due to a weather delay on our first flight and failure to hold a plane in Atlanta for 10 mins despite it being the last plane of the night and there being 22 connecting passengers all on the same plane. Gate staff were rude and unhelpful. Desk staff didn't know what they were doing initially offering us a route from Atlanta to JFK to Dublin to Manchester. Ended up coming back via Dublin 24 hours later but others got a direct flight. Told there were no hotel rooms in the area. After much persistence we found a hotel room nearby at 1am. Given vouchers for $25 per person to pay for food for a full 24 hours which was nowhere near what it actually cost us. Inflight entertainment systems were a problem for many passengers on the way out though ours worked but on the way back 3/5 of ours didn't work. There was no apology from cabin crew we were just told there was nothing they could do about it. The difference in customer service when we switched to Aer Lingus in Dublin for the final part of our trip was excellent! Would rather pay a little more in future and feel that any problems would be dealt with effectively.
10213,Delta Air Lines,4-Sep-13,Ireland,10,Economy,5,YES,I recently flew with my wife and 6 year old from Dublin to Denver via Atlanta with Delta. Flights were all on time. Food was good seat was comfortable even though I was in economy. Leg room was fine. We had inflight personal TV screens on if seat back with multiple Movies TV games etc. The crew were very friendly and provided a great service. In my view Delta is the best airline crossing the Atlantic out of Ireland. Keep up the good work.
10214,Delta Air Lines,3-Sep-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Aug 31 203 left Tampa Florida with a connecting flight to Vegas through Atlanta. After 1.5 hr delay in Tampa we were put on a flight to Atlanta in Atlanta we learn our connecting flight had departed from there we were sent to customer service - told no other flights were available tonight and there were no hotels rooms available. I'm traveling with my family there is 4 of us and before we even left Tampa Delta knew that once we landed in Atlanta we were ultimately stranded. Our options are to sleep in the airport until 8am? This is my first time flying Delta they have been the worst flying experience of my life. The biggest insult of the day? Offered a $50 voucher for our troubles.
10215,Delta Air Lines,3-Sep-13,Belgium,10,Business,5,YES,New York JFK to Brussels. For an 8-hour intercontinental flight a minimum of comfort can be expected. At terminal 4 of JFK airport Delta offers customers the chance to skip lines for baggage drop off. You can simply check in your bags outside which saves you a lot of time. On board the flight crew members are kind the food is exquisite and business class offers the possibility to get some good night's rest. On arrival again Delta employees are awaiting passengers leaving the aircraft to guide them to either the baggage drop off or to their connecting flight and provide all the information you need. We landed half an hour ahead of schedule.
10216,Delta Air Lines,3-Sep-13,UK,3,Economy,2,NO,The service was less than average. It kicked off with a delay of our flight from London. Then we were told the plane we were to fly was being cleaned. One of the air hostess was rude to me and the food was poor. The connecting flight at Detroit did not bother to wait I was put on the next flight which was several hours away and no vouchers were provided. The flight from Detroit to Phoenix was also late and the same scenario repeated itself travelling back from Phoenix to London. The economy seats were particularly small and uncomfortable and the food was less than average compared to flights of a similar price.
10217,Delta Air Lines,2-Sep-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew Orlando to Manchester via Paris. The worst flight in 30 years of travel. Additional stop added and not notified in Atlanta. Clear they were cramming in three flights into one - gotta save those costs ! As for 'mechanical ' excuse for additional stop/change - odd as three fights were being called to board same plane - doesn't wash with me. The plane from Atlanta to Paris was so old I seriously doubted it would make it. The central panel and trim were loose it rattled and majority of headsets did not work so the overhead screen (none on the back of seats) were a waste of time. The staff were clearly either fed up or just so long in the tooth past caring as showed complete disinterest at my concerns as my party of six were split including two young children. Spoke to other passengers who also had families split and no sound! Absolute disgrace especially as could have got tickets cheaper if had wanted two stops.
10218,Delta Air Lines,30-Aug-13,France,9,Business,4,YES,EWR to CDG on a new 767. New business class flat seats that are quite comfortable but very narrow even for a normal sized guy. Entertainment system outstanding - very good and extensive choices. Food is OK. Lounge in EWR quite poor. The crew was exceptionally charming and really tried their utmost. All in all not a bad option on this route better than AF but Openskies probably somewhat ahead with broader flat seats and very good pre dining service in the EWR BA lounge.
10219,Delta Air Lines,29-Aug-13,Japan,8,Business,4,YES,NRT-PDX-ATL-RDU-MSP-NRT in business class. Very fortunate to have traveled with no delays or cancellations on all legs. Domestically the flights are in first class which is what economy used to be like when I traveled in the 80's. Internationally the flights are lie-flat beds and quite comfortable. The food and catering is always good. While it's not gourmet they make an effort and do feed generous amounts and portions. The entertainment isn't quite as cutting edge as it was a few years ago but still more than adequate. The 767 from NRT to PDX has very very narrow lie-flat seats that were not great for sleeping unless you're on your back. The 777 from MSP to NRT on the other hand is wide enough even for a portly man like myself to sleep on my side. When you fly an American carrier you know what to expect. Delta continues to treat me well but cannot be compared to international competitors for the most part.
10220,Delta Air Lines,29-Aug-13,Germany,8,Business,4,YES,Frankfurt - Detroit in Business-Elite which is great with the new seats but the quality of the seats is low. The seat would not move until I really shook it. And to return it to the landing position I really had to shake it hard again. The IFE is not working 100% perfect though the seats were only introduced recently. The controllers probably did not want to understand that 'cheap' could be more 'expensive' in the end. Food is always strange in business. Not sure what the people who create the menu think about their passengers. Detroit - Lax was in Economy Comfort which was ok not great. The return flight was all first/business-elite and besides the food all was great. We used miles to upgrade but still cheaper that most other carriers. So Delta (and its partners) will remain my choice.
10221,Delta Air Lines,27-Aug-13,Australia,10,Premium,4,YES,SFO to LAX economy comfort - my first ever flight with Delta and after being somewhat sceptical have to say I was extremely pleasantly surprised. Dead on time new aircraft good room pleasant crew and very quick and easy check-in. Put my Delta doubts to rest!
10222,Delta Air Lines,27-Aug-13,UK,2,Economy,2,NO,JFK to LHR on 767-400. Lines for security horrendous on a Sunday evening at Deltas new T4 with lots of people headed to Europe. Delta don't show this in advertising the new T4! Boarding quick but the economy (dis)comfort seat is not worth paying extra for. No discernible pitch increase and no difference in service. Crew typical Delta - octogenarians mixed with one tall Russian chap who looked and acted like a Bond villain. Food awful drinks scarce and the breakfast box disgusting before landing. One hard piece of toast with sugar syrup to spread on it and lukewarm coffee you could kill a cat with. Seat as hard as the crews attitude and no cushioning. Fly Delta only if all other options fail. Miserable.
10223,Delta Air Lines,27-Aug-13,USA,1,Business,1,NO,Flight DL 67 from Zurich to Atlanta. Delay of 7 hours plus. Chaotic situation at check-in. No alternatives offered until insisted to use an alternative partner airline the next day.
10224,Delta Air Lines,23-Aug-13,Sweden,2,Economy,1,NO,Very chaotic check in at JFK for Europe. We tried to book our seats in advance and noticed that all 3 of us 2 adults and one child of 9 were seated apart. No one at the gate would help us. Once on the overcrowded flight we found the flight crew rude who made it clear that it would be my job to negotiate with other passengers if I wanted to sit with my family. Long unassisted walk to gate where a bus would ship us off to another terminal. Lousy service from beginning to end. The cabin crew wouldn't leave us in peace they insisted on making announcements until they were blue in the face.
10225,Delta Air Lines,22-Aug-13,UK,10,Economy,4,YES,Recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta and Buffalo return over a weekend. I have read the reviews and on my last Delta flights I would agree that they need to try much harder. However my latest experience was vastly different. All flights on time very courteous crews and ground staff and delicious food on the transatlantic sectors. So I'm happy to fly Delta again.
10226,Delta Air Lines,22-Aug-13,France,0,Economy,1,NO,I had a connecting Delta flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. At first we were told that apparently the flight was overbooked and even though we had confirmed reservations we may not get seats. We were made to wait some 45 minutes before being told that they can accommodate us. On the Delta flight to Tallahassee from Atlanta I was given a seat separate from my girlfriend. The woman at the counter was extremely rude and told us that she doesn't have any more seats together. What is the point of reserving or even checking-in in advance when they can't assure a seat or assign you a seat number right away! Then on our flight from Miami airport the flight was 30 minutes late we saw passengers from the aircraft exiting through the gate we were supposed to board from. Another first for me. After that no announcements were made to tell people who did not have US/Canada passports that they need to check with the Delta counter. So they started picking people from the boarding queue to check last minute passport information. Once again the woman at the counter was extremely rude. Delta needs a lesson in hospitality from middle-eastern airlines and even European airlines who have an impeccable service. My trip to the US was amazing but the Delta experience was horrible.
10227,Delta Air Lines,22-Aug-13,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,Seattle-Amsterdam-Mumbai. Flight from Seattle to Amsterdam on Airbus 330-200. It was quite spacious but that is the best I can say about the flight. I was in row 30. The seats had no padding whatsoever and the flight staff were very unfriendly. I asked for a soda and didn't get it until 3 hours later! The food was fair but some elements of the dish were superb. AVOD was excellent with good choices for entertainment. From Amsterdam to Mumbai was the killer. I think it was a Boeing 767. The seats were all torn up and coming apart. There was no AVOD only the overhead screen and that broke down for half the flight. The staff were ignorant and the food disgusting. I made a huge mistake booking Delta and I am never going to fly Delta again.
10228,Delta Air Lines,20-Aug-13,Singapore,1,Economy,1,NO,Due to whatever reason my United flight got canceled. Although I had a first class ticket if I wanted to get to Atlanta from La Guardia NY the same day the only option was to transfer to a Delta economy flight. United's appalling quality of service being a separate issue the Delta flight was also a shocker. The 757-200 was very old. My seat was ripped and dirty. Onboard service? What service! The only bonus was a wifi system that worked well.
10229,Delta Air Lines,16-Aug-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"My red-eye flight from PDX to JFK in Y on Aug 14th was marred by poor customer service a hot stuffy plane that was completely packed and an uncomfortable seat. I booked my flight more than 2 months out and was still stuck with a middle seat and call center agents offered no help but instead tried to up-sell various products like priority boarding. Checking in online I forked over an additional $50 for a window seat (15A) in a section normally reserved for medallion members. Boarding was a laughably chaotic process and I noticed that half the passengers on this sold out flight had ""priority"" boarding (nothing speedy or ""priority"" about 50+ passengers trying to board all at once). The seat itself was decent but the legroom was appalling; I'm 5'10 and my knees were touching the seat in front of me. Add to that a hot stuffy cabin and non-existent service - I saw one round of beverage service on a 5-hr flight and no beverage runs after - and you get a truly uncomfortable flight. The experience was in stark contrast to the enjoyable flight I took on Alaska Airlines from Philadelphia to Seattle (non-stop) a week prior."
10230,Delta Air Lines,16-Aug-13,India,7,Economy,4,YES,JFK-LAX-HNL. Arrived late into JFK informed by ground staff that they could not guarantee that my bags would make the flight. Given the option to rebook on the next flight I checked at the gate and my bags had been loaded. The 767 was an international configuration flight with an excellent entertainment system. Aircraft was refurbished and the seating was quite comfortable even by long-haul standards. While I avoid flying economy class long-haul on American and European carriers and stick to Asian ones I would definitely consider Delta. Economy Plus which was sold out on this flight looked particularly spacious. Crew were very friendly. Typical to US carriers Delta offers a food for purchase scheme. I would only ask them to have better healthy options and fresh hot food for purchase on these longer transcon legs rather then snack boxes. Still crew were efficient and friendly. Arrival in LAX was 30 minutes ahead of schedule and bags were on the belt. LAX-HNL. This flight was delayed 3 hours. Fortunately given the option to switch to the earlier flight and even my economy plus seating was honored. Boeing 757 was in an older configuration with overhead screens. While nowhere near as nice as the 767 the service once again was friendly and efficient and I made it to Honolulu 3 hours before I was due to arrive. Economy plus seating with extra legroom is an excellent option at a very reasonable cost.
10231,Delta Air Lines,15-Aug-13,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,Must be a frequent flyer to get a decent seat. My husband and I arrived at the airport 3 hours early and were told we had to wait to be assigned our seats even though we were the first of about 10 people to be assigned a seat (10 minutes before boarding which really raised my anxiety level) I was given the very back seat - 20D and my husband was beside me the couple assigned after us were given seats in aisle 18. I got the no window/no recline seat and he got the one next to the toilet on both flights. My biggest complaint is they board the front first and work their way to the back boarding takes so long it delayed us by an extra 30 minutes and both my flights were late - most likely because of their boarding policies. How does it serve the first class if their late too as we have to wait to get seated while everyone in the front is trying to store baggage in the aisles? This is a great airline for people who want to feel privilege at a low cost and don't mind being late all the time. I take this flight 3 times a year and this will be my last I will take the AA flight through O'Hare from now on.
10232,Delta Air Lines,13-Aug-13,USA,0,Business,1,NO,My daughter was traveling this weekend from Orlando to Fort Walton Beach to arrive Thursday night and return Sunday afternoon. That was the original plan and the ticket was purchased and paid for weeks in advance. Connecting flight out of Atlanta Thursday night was cancelled after waiting for more than 2 hours delayed. Hotel voucher and overnight in Atlanta arrived Friday at noon. Sunday flight we stood in line for more than an hour to check a bag until they closed the baggage drop off. She re-packed her bag - to take care of the liquids - in line for TSA and according to them then her hands 'alerted' for explosives. She was taken to a back room strip searched and missed her flight. Neither Delta nor TSA had any apologies for us. She's a teacher and now will not be in class tomorrow for her students. Why make plans?
10233,Delta Air Lines,12-Aug-13,USA,8,Business,4,YES,ATL-AMS 8/1/13 A330-300. Traveling with my son. Managed to get first row bulkhead. This flight didn't have the lie flat seats but I've always preferred the older style on DL. Service always good in BE and this was no exception. I know some complain about DL but I really feel that service on Delta's business elite product is always well done. On time arrival. Overall a good experience.
10234,Delta Air Lines,12-Aug-13,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,NRT-BKK. Connected to BKK from SEA via NRT. Flight left on time. Upgraded 747-400. Seat was comfortable with the additional leg room and recline in Economy Comfort. The small fee paid for the upgrade was worth it. Food was adequate and choices were available between entrees. Free alcohol in Economy Comfort but did not see many passengers taking advantage of this perk. Lots of overhead storage on this airplane. Flight crew spoke Thai and announcements were made in English Japanese and Thai. Flight crew did not smile much although service was prompt and attentive. For an American airline flying an international route the crew and level of service needs to grow more in level of friendliness to compete with Asian airlines flying the same routes. Would choose again if I had to because of cost but not service.
10235,Delta Air Lines,12-Aug-13,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,SEA-NRT. First time flying Economy Comfort with Delta. The 747-400 cabin was redone and actually had good sized overhead storage. The added inches between me and front seat made getting in and out easier. Inflight entertainment did not work for the first hour of the flight. Once working the IFE was adequate for a 10 hour flight with lots of music Western and Asian movies and even games. Added recline for the seat made sleeping a little better but still sitting up while sleeping. Food was adequate and a snack was served between meals and you got a hot sandwich before you landed. Flight crew worked together well but did not smile much. Pilot was good and gave us warning to return to seats with turbulence ahead. Overall it was satisfactory with departure and arrival on schedule.
10236,Delta Air Lines,9-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Direct flight PHL to CVG cancelled automated call just before I was leaving for the airport stating they were rebooking me on a flight leaving 5 hrs later with a layover in NY arriving CVG at 11pm vs my plan of 3.30. Rebooked on a flight through Detroit. Flight leaving PHL was delayed upon arrival in Detroit I sprinted to my gate to find it just closed and they would not open the door the attendant would even try. They said I had been rebooked on a 735 flight. I didn't receive any notification or update on my delta app. Delta service and attitude toward their customers has become worse since they acquired NW.
10237,Delta Air Lines,8-Aug-13,China,9,Economy,5,YES,I flew Delta twice these past 2 months. First flight from Beijing was good. Second flight was from Tokyo Narita arrived early (4 hours before flight) surprised that Delta was open and I could check in straight away without waiting. Staff very competent polite and professional. Flight itself was comfortable and pleasant (little bumpy- however the captain had given an early notice - I appreciate this as I am not a great flyer). I will definitely use Delta again.
10238,Delta Air Lines,8-Aug-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Just returned from Orlando! Flights were all fine food good on transatlantic flights didn't have anything on short hop internal flights so can't comment staff were friendly (even entertaining at times on return flight) in flight entertainment great all had our own TV with loads of choice (it did freeze 2 hours before landing at Heathrow but it was the middle of the night and everyone was sleeping anyway so didn't bother us). We flew LHR- BOS-MCO outbound and MCO-ATL-LHR inbound. The only problem was we were delayed a couple of hours at Boston due to thunder storms delaying incoming plane. But nothing that Delta could help and they kept us well informed. I will definitely use again as nearly half the price of Virgin and BA!
10239,Delta Air Lines,7-Aug-13,USA,8,Business,5,YES,Flew from Cincinnati to Hong Kong and return via JFK. Took an early flight out of Cincinnati to LGA for an early lunch meeting. Aircraft was a tired old CRJ. Full as usual. Delta really needs to upgrade equipment out of CVG. Flight from JFK to Tokyo left on time. Seats were excellent. However service was sub par on this flight and they did not help when my overhead light was stuck on during flight. Very difficult to sleep with the light on. Felt quite weary and tired by the time I got into Hong Kong. Return went very smoothly. Got the upper deck on the 747 to JFK. Was extremely impressed by the level of privacy offered. Service was great and it was possibly the best flight I've had. Naturally flight to Cincinnati was delayed but we made it back relatively on time. Delta is doing a great job of providing lie-flat seats on all its flights to Asia. Will be doing this route again in 2 months via DTW.
10240,Delta Air Lines,5-Aug-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,I have tried Delta twice in the past year and will not fly them again. They cancelled a flight which happens in the summer however I just happened to be watching the flight status and caught it. They did not notify me for close to 6 hours. It is not possible to book another flight online. You have to call by the time I got through I could not get on the next flight. Once I did reach a customer service person she was not very pleasant. The other trip I flew with them I had a different problem. I arrived at the airport within an hour of the flight departure. I had to wait in line for a few people in order to check my bag. By the time it was my turn it was less than an hour to flight time and the gate agent would not let me board. She said she could go ahead and send my luggage but not me. This was at small airport. If there was time to get my bag to the plane I don't see why I could not have boarded the commuter flight. I had checked in online but she said I arrived at the airport too late to board. Booked a flight on the spot with another airline the cost was over $1000.
10241,Delta Air Lines,5-Aug-13,USA,5,Economy,5,YES,LAX-HND-LAX. Delta knows to stay competitive with international airliners servicing this route and their economy class service was quite good. There was plenty of leg room on the flight good meals and pleasant service for both legs of the trip. Haneda routes seem to be red-eye and the cabin was comfortable. I don't like flying Delta and would not recommend them for domestic US flights but they do a good job on this particular international route.
10242,Delta Air Lines,31-Jul-13,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,San Diego to Oakland (via Los Angeles) and back a couple of days later. Slight (15 mins) delay in boarding but since there was an hour layover in LAX originally in the schedule we made it to Oakland on time. Coming back I gave myself ample time to check in and the flight was on-time. Seats were comfortable I was on row 10 or 14 CRJ900. My only suggestion is for the flight attendants to get to the beverage service a little bit faster tended to forget what passengers were asking for and had to keep going back to ask them - not efficient. No refreshments on the San Diego to LA part of the flight (short flight) but refreshments are served from Oakland to LA flight. Ground staff and the baggage handlers were nice and friendly. Some delay on getting our hand carried bags when we deplaned.
10243,Delta Air Lines,31-Jul-13,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,07/19/2013 DL3655 DSM-YVR. Terrible customer service. Our plane broke down and we were put onto another flight. The airline promised a window or aisle seat and I ended up in the middle between 2 large people. There were empty seats all over the plane and nothing was done to make that long flight a pleasant experience.
10244,Delta Air Lines,30-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Wilmington NC to LaGuardia NY. Received message of cancelled flight 45 minutes before leaving for airport. Rescheduled for flight 3.5 hours later. That flight was then delayed for over 3 hours and eventually cancelled kept saying it was weather related. Booked us for flight at 6 am the next morning started taxiing out and stopped for a 45 minute delay. Finally got to LaGuardia and found that our next flight had been cancelled. Instead of leaving at 9.40am we left at 2.55pm took over 30 hours to finally get to Toronto. The most distressing fact was we were traveling with our elderly parents (78 Years of age) and Delta was unsympathetic and unaccomodating. Hope I never have to fly Delta again.
10245,Delta Air Lines,30-Jul-13,USA,3,Business,1,NO,JFK to Amsterdam Business Class on a tired but refurbished 767. Departure was 45 minutes late and 2 agents at the gate refused to make any announcement as to new departure time. New truly shrunken pods with full-flat seats that are painfully narrow. Tiny old LCD screen. There were four dinner selections and one cold-plate. I was in the 3d row and informed that neither the cold-plate nor 2 out of 4 selections were available really? What I ended up with was a hair above coach and I returned it. Cabin staff was good however. I've flown Delta Biz for years and while never up to the standards of the competition this was really pathetic. If you add the new JFK Delta terminal (a nightmare) and the ticket price there is no reason to fly Delta to Europe.
10246,Delta Air Lines,29-Jul-13,USA,10,Business,5,YES,Flew DTW to LHR and AMS to DTW - Food was plentiful and tasty seats were lay-flat and I slept well for a few hours. I didn't spend much time using the entertainment system so I can't comment on that. Business elite passengers are first-on first-off first to get luggage first in line at customs. No complaints at all. Skylounge at DTW was self-serve and comfortable.
10247,Delta Air Lines,29-Jul-13,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,Our family of six took Delta from Milwaukee to Atlanta. A nice layover let us all eat to prepare for the connection to Montego Bay Jamaica. Everything actually went very smooth at Milwaukee Airport as it always does. No problems with staff baggage or seating. The transfers at Atlanta with timely and easy. The flight and communication with staff was very good. Actually the return was the same. I have nothing to complain about on any of the four flights we took. I would consider them first again. Especially after reading other reviews of many airlines on this site.
10248,US Airways,21-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I had read horrible reviews about U.S Airways while planning my trip so I specifically went to American Airlines website paid $100 more for my tickets and booked my flight through American Airlines. I received all my email confirmations from American Airlines. When I arrived at the airport I went to American Airlines check in they tell me they don't have that flight. In very small print at the bottom of my confirmation it said U.S. Airways. I went over to the U.S. Airways check in counter to check my bag. I was flying with a firearm so they have to inspect it. My flight was set to leave at 7.45 am. While sitting at the gate waiting you could see they were working on our plane. Then came time to board and they told us it would be just a little while longer. They finally started boarding us at 8.00 am. At 9.00 we were still sitting on the runway waiting on mechanics at 9.30 they deboarded us from the plane and said it would be about 10.30 am before we departed. Sat at the gate area and at 11.30 they cancelled our flight. They gave everyone a card with a phone number to call to get on another flight. I called and got on an 8.45 pm flight that night. I sat at the airport for 16.5 hours waiting for the next flight to leave at 5.30 I got a phone call from U.S Airways saying the flight would be delayed until 9.30 pm. When I got to the gate it was pushed back to 9.50 pm. Finally after much hesitation I had to call and take myself off the flight and find my luggage. When I looked up that flight later it did not actually leave until 10.45 pm. When I went to go claim my luggage after about 30 minutes of not being able to locate it they discovered it was in Phoenix. It apparently made it on an earlier flight that it was not tagged for. I finally got it back at 8.30 pm the following evening.
10249,US Airways,17-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Some friends and I booked flights from Nashville to St. Thomas. From there we were to take a cab to a ferry to Marina Cay. Lo and behold our flight was delayed due to maintenance. This caused us to miss the last ferry out resulting in a hotel stay in St. Thomas. As if that were not bad enough. one week later on our way back to the US we arrived at the St. Thomas airport three hours early for our flight. None of the kiosks worked to check in and there wasn't a single employee working. Luckily we had so much time. The passengers flying out on an earlier flight had experienced much worse panic when they were unable to check in to their flight that was leaving in less than an hour. Once all eight employees arrived at the same exact time we waited in a ridiculous long line of frustrated people. Happy to finally get to our gate we learned that our flight was delayed due to maintenance again!
10250,US Airways,17-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,Airplane itself seemed newer than the planes I have been on in the past (I usually fly Delta). But after a 10 hour flight from Rome to Charlotte we arrive to find out flight to Tallahassee was cancelled. The customer service person was polite but kept getting distracted as she rebooked us on a Delta flight to get us home 4 hours later than originally planned. Our luggage made it the next day. I started researching and find out that cancelled flights are a frequent problem on US Airways. Don't fly them if you want to get where you are going on time!
10251,US Airways,11-Jun-14,Canada,0,Economy,3,NO,US Airways now stoops to lying. Boarding my flight today I had to sit through the usual nonsense announcements that the flight is fully booked and overhead luggage storage is limited so customers should come up to the podium to check their bags. In the past I have ignored these pleas and I have not had a problem. I never check my baggage if I can help it because the best case is that you waste 30 to 45 minutes at your destination waiting for your bags to come down the carrousel. Worst case the airline loses your baggage or locks it up and leaves for the day because you make the mistake of going to the washroom before going to the carrousel. Today US Airways didn't achieve their quota of checked baggage so they decided to step it up a notch and report that one passenger has already come to the front of the airplane to check his baggage because the overhead storage is completely full so I dutifully went to the podium to check my bag. What do I find when I board the plane? Lots of available overhead storage. I am completely incensed at this behaviour and will not fly US Airways again if I can help it.
10252,US Airways,9-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,We flew Houston-Charlotte-Lisbon (5/24/14). Flight 760 over wasn't too bad food was ok for coach. It was booked for us by Road Scholar as part of our travel package. I didn't have high expectations but it wasn't bad for being economy. The return US 761 (6/2/14) was the trip from hell starting with the oldest 757 I've ever flown. Late leaving Lisbon stupidest security personnel ever encountered. The front economy toilet had been repaired with putty glue you name it didn't work properly. Crew just plain didn't give a flip about passengers or service on board. Luckily both flights were about 50-60% full so you could stretch out. I will avoid this airline like the plague and any variation the merger with AA cooks up - even if I pay extra.
10253,US Airways,6-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,Manchester UK - Philadelphia - New York. Totally satisfied great food modern inflight entertainment crew was nice flight delayed by 90 mins - did not bother me. People at the desk in Philadelphia very helpful. Was worried about this trip after reading only negative reviews but I must say I was very pleased. I fly the US - EU route every month (always a different airline though). I would definitely recommend US Airways.
10254,US Airways,6-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Never ever use this airline. Took me two days to get from JFK to Oakland instead of the 5-6 hrs it takes normally. Worst flight experience ever.
10255,US Airways,5-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I was very unhappy with my trip - flights delayed both ways and of course the connecting flight couldn't wait. I made a mad dash across the Charlotte airport from Concourse B to E (or was it the other way round?) to try to catch it though there were less than 5 minutes; I guess I hoped it might be delayed just a little bit too. But no they don't wait. On the way back two days later the Charlotte flight was delayed twice then cancelled so I got a non-stop to Miami at 7 pm rather than my original 12.50 flight. More than 6 extra hours waiting in the airport with nothing offered to make up for it. Oh yes I got switched to American since they're now the same company but US airways personnel couldn't assign my seat and I had to wait until actual boarding to get a back row seat. I think I will avoid this airline in the future if at all possible! In-air personnel were very nice about fixing my drink the way I liked it so I'll rate them higher.
10256,US Airways,4-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,When I was traveling to Phoenix on 5/29/2014 I had purchased a ticket leaving Spokane at 9am in the morning and arriving at 11.30. However when I printed out my boarding pass it now showed that I was to arrive at the airport at 6am and arrive in Phoenix at 9.30am. I was now stuck at the airport for 5 hours! I was not notified of the change as had to scramble to find a new ride to the airport much earlier than I had expected! This is very inconvenient! There was no email or phone call to notify that this had changed. When I departed Phoenix on 6/1/2014 I again got my boarding pass and was told to proceed to gate B10. 10 minutes before my flight should have boarded myself and 5 other passengers were looking for someone at the gate for B10 no one was there! We flagged down another airport worker and were notified that our plane was now going out of gate A3! Again no notification email or update on the US Airways phone app to let us know that the gate had changed. As it was I and the other passengers had to run to make the flight departure at gate A3. I am physically able to do this. I know that an elderly passenger would not have been able to make it as it was quite a distance away in the terminal. This is not acceptable. Any changes and corrections in flight times and gates should be updated by US Airways on the website or an email/phone app should be notified. This should lay solely on US Airways to get this information out. As it stands this was my first and last flight with US Airways and I will go out of my way to NOT fly your airline again. I was not happy with these changes and the inconvenience it provided for me.
10257,US Airways,4-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,"I just came home from a week in Ireland and flew US Air from Shannon to Philadelphia. After spending a week with friendly helpful smiling people in Ireland I encountered the least friendly rudest crew I have ever seen on any flight. The flight wasn't just Americans returning home but Irish people flying to America for maybe the first time. What a terrible impression they must have made! First of all they were a mess - they didn't even appear clean. No one said hello how are you etc. Food service (and the food) was terrible. Two of the women flight attendants were arguing in the aisle over the beverage cart about how to dispose of cans. I asked for a cup of tea with milk and sugar and got one milk. When I asked for another milk you would have thought I asked her for champagne. I swear I saw some of them roll their eyes at people. When we arrived we were welcomed to Philadelphia by ""your Philadelphia-based crew"" - what a bunch of miserable unhappy impolite people. They are all in the wrong profession. On the way off the aircraft no one said goodbye have a nice day or anything. It was my worst flight experience ever. US Airways needs to work on customer service. Another observation was at Philadelphia airport while sitting at the gate for my connecting flight."
10258,US Airways,3-Jun-14,USA,0,Business,0,NO,"What a nightmare. Numerous delays and cancellations both going to and returning from my business destination. Staff rude and unhelpful. Planes dirty. Multiple reports of mechanical difficulties or weather as cause of delays but no other airline seemed to have weather issues. I needed help getting another flight to get home to my son. The attendant at the gate told me to ""Try Delta."" Guess what? I will."
10259,US Airways,3-Jun-14,USA,0,First Class,1,NO,While flight was diverted from PHX to CLT upon arrival in CLT flight was delayed continually while changing gates 3 times - for 5 hours! Finally at 1.30 in the morning they tell us the flight is cancelled because they don't have a Pilot! They left hundreds of people to sleep on the floor of the Charlotte airport. Not even offered a bottle of cold water.
10260,US Airways,3-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Since February US Air has been an unmitigated disaster. Had 2 early morning flights back to back in Tampa cancelled on 2 brand new Airbus 320. Then a cancelled flight due to a bent fan blade in Ottawa where I then had to spend the night. Ground operations in Charlotte are a joke and even with 2 hr layovers I have had to scramble to make my connections. Then last night in Washington all is good until 30 min before departure then I get the email notice flight is cancelled. Call US Air. Cancellation due to another mechanical issue on a CRJ 200. I then chose to drive the 3 hours home. These US Air personnel are a joke. The passengers are held as hostages with one pack off lies told on top of another. You just hope you show up at your destination the same day you leave.
10261,US Airways,30-May-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Planned family trip to Europe with family fight from Charlotte to London Heathrow (flight 730) on May 15 2014. Flight was delayed 4 times then cancelled at 1 am no hotels in Charlotte due to Nascar race no help from US Air reps actually all rude family had to sleep in airport got $10.00 food voucher that buys a lot in airport. Next morning. Put on flight to LaGuardia almost didn't make because they had our luggage locked up in Charlotte no one there to unlock until flight time very stressful got to LaGuardia had to pay for cab to JFK then wait until 6.30 pm for flight to London. Will avoid at all costs.
10262,US Airways,27-May-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,This has been the most stressful trip I have taken. Hearing my flight have been canceled 2 times waiting at the airport for 6 hours and having to wait in lines with 100+ people is the worst thing that has happened in all of my trips I've taken with an airline. I reached my mid-way point in Charlotte North Carolina rushing to my flight that was suppose to take off in 30 minutes. They then announce that the flight has been canceled and that we go visit the service desk. Almost about an hour wait. Once I got to talk to one of the service agents she was really rude and barely communicated with me. She then found me a flight 4 hours from then. The flight attendants then told us to walk to a different gate to a later time to fly to Nashville. I am never going to be looking at US Airlines to fly again.
10263,US Airways,25-May-14,Ireland,3,Economy,3,NO,"Delays on all booked flights. Outward bound - Dublin to Philadelphia Philadelphia to Vegas. Vegas to LA. Baggage did not make the connection from Phil to Vegas. arrived some hours later. Cabin staff were unfriendly and quite rude. From Dublin We were sitting at the back of the plane and there was no selection of meal available and we were told ""thats what you get when you travel at the back"" . I opened my little tub of butter which had been heated to the extent that when I opened it it was in hot liquid and went all over my hand. I said to the stewardess who was passing by who could have brought me a napkin to wipe the liquid off my hands - but she sped by saying ""oh I know that happens"". Only that I had a tray of food on my lap she would have had more to deal with! We were told by cabin crew that all baggage was to be stored in the overhead lockers or underneath the seat in front. This obviously does not apply to cabin staff whose baggage was piled high on the back centre aisle seats of the plane it was not secured in any way. Their baggage was a danger to all the passengers in that area. Maybe the company should practice what they preach and put staff baggage in the hold. Cabin crew were ungroomed in appearance. Homeward bound to Dublin. Flight from Philadelphia to Orlando delayed resulting in us overnighting in Orlando very grateful for the overnight accommodation provided at the Hyatt. Flew to Charlotte the next day for flight to Dublin. Boarding for Dublin at Charlotte was very confused and inefficiently exercised by Gate staff - resulting in delay in take-off. Entertainment delivery was of very poor quality on those flights that had the facility. General impression overall. Very Disappointing."
10264,US Airways,22-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,This flight was conducted like a zoo. Three women with their children on the flight requested to change their seats. Passengers and the flight attendant tried to comply with their request. Actually they farmed all their kids out and the 3 mothers sat together drinking wine for the whole flight. Their children did not fasten their seat belts until other passengers reminded them too. The plane had to move after attempting to attach the new jetway without success. Nobody instructed the passengers to sit down so people were going to the bathroom children were jumping on the seats and luggage was in the walkway while they moved the plane to a new jetway. The flight attendant was not looking out for anyone's safety. I could not wait to get off this plane!
10265,US Airways,22-May-14,Canada,2,Economy,3,NO,"Terrible. I had two flights which connected in Philadelphia. The first was 5.5 hours long from San Francisco to Philadephia; no entertainment whatsoever no complimentary snacks and extremely uncomfortable seats. The second was from Philadelphia to Toronto; delayed 3 hours due to maintenance all of the food service had closed in that Terminal at 8pm. I had just come off the 5.5 hour flight and was starving. We finally boarded the flight attendant was very rude. I asked if there was any way I could have any nuts or something as I was so hungry he rudely said ""No this is a short flight I'm sure you will survive."" (There was no other food service offered). The flight was only about an hour: they continually shut off all the lights as if people were to sleep and they turn all the fluorescents on again - this happened 5 or 6 times within the hour. I will never fly US Airways again unless they step up their game it was a very unpleasant day."
10266,US Airways,20-May-14,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,"Online reservations and ticketing was fine. Check in fine. Philadelphia terminal a filthy unsanitary mess. Carpet strewn with trash half eaten food and beverages dirty seats burned out light bulbs. Boarding process a shambles. I paid the asking price for my ticket and purchased it long in advance of my flight. I was seated mid cabin on an aisle. There were 5 boarding groups called. How I ended up in the last Group 5 is beyond me. So I ended up stumbling over a planeload of passengers to get to my seat. Inflight I had the audacity to request a second beverage after finishing my first. I had paid for an inflight meal that was loaded with salt and needed a drink. As the flight attendant was passing through the aisle I politely asked for another beverage ""whenever you get the chance I know you're busy"". The reply: ""It won't be any time soon. Water and coffee only"". The same attendant walked past 3 times empty-handed before I asked a second attendant for the beverage. I received no reply and was really certain that I hadn't been heard. A few minutes later the drink arrived which is good and bad. Good: I got my drink. Bad: There seems to be no feeling by the attendants that passenger requests need be acknowledged. I have tired and tried with US Airways. American Airlines hasn't helped them one bit. Perhaps to the contrary. Look elsewhere for your transportation needs if at all possible."
10267,US Airways,20-May-14,UK,7,Economy,4,YES,DUB-PHL-DTW-PHL-DUB on A330-200 & Embraer 175. The aircraft were clean and seemed relatively new. All flights ran early - with the exception on the last one which had a minor 20 minute delay. The US immigration pre-clearance in Dublin was very good. The food was not great but not bad either and the same goes for the inflight service. The wine was unpalatable. IFE on the A330 was great - lots of new films. No IFE on the short flight but this is not expected. All in all - good flights and as expected. Nothing to get excited by. US Airways is not a 4 or 5 star airline but does not seem to claim to be that either. They seem to be on a par with most other North American carriers. I would fly with them again but would prefer to fly BA or Virgin if I had the option.
10268,US Airways,20-May-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,I flew US Airways from Honolulu to Phoenix and the service and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The staff in Honolulu was fantastic and went out of their way to quickly and efficiently get everyone through check in and onto the flight (there was a huge line at check in). They even checked bags at no cost to help speed along the process. Once on the flight things quickly deteriorated. People were packed in like sardines and we were asked to pay for sleeping packs. With little to no room to move it was a miserable 6 hrs. Once off the flight the customer service representative was incredibly rude when I asked to be placed on a stand by flight leaving sooner to my final destination. I was forcefully educated that just because U.S. Airways and American airways have merged you cannot schedule or a adjust American flights with U.S. Overall this experience was trying given how much I spent on flights. I recommend Southwest for future flights and warn others to keep clear of flying US Airways or American Airlines.
10269,US Airways,12-May-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,I cannot begin to tell you how consistently terrible this airline is. I was flying recently from Washington DC to Portland Maine. The pilot came over the loudspeaker and said we were going to set down in Philly. A light was going off that indicated that the door was not shut correctly. So we went into Philly where some of us made other arrangements others had to wait a day. A week later I was flying from Detroit back to Maine and had a 2 hour layover in Philly. I thought that this would be ample time to make my next flight but U.S. Airways missed the connection. When I went to the service counter they said it would be two days before I could get out of Philly. I went to another counter and they said it would be a day before I could get out but that I was on my own for hotel accommodations. Please do yourself a favor and stay away from US Airways.
10270,US Airways,12-May-14,France,5,Economy,1,NO,I was travelling from Paris to Houston for business. As a last minute surprise my company offered to purchase a domestic ticket so that I could see my family in Pennsylvania which I gladly accepted. All in all I flew Paris- Charlotte Charlotte-Houston Houston-Dallas and Dallas-DC. I drove to Pennsylvania from DC. The day before my flight back to Paris I went online to check-in and noticed that I actually had to fly DC-Philly then Philly to Paris so I called US Airways to ask if I could simply check-in in Philly. They replied that this would be a $300 up-charge even though I was asking to eliminate a portion of my journey. I spoke with 3 customer service representatives and they all told me that since a direct flight was more expensive that I would need to pay more to fly less. It makes sense when booking a flight online that a direct journey would be more expensive than a non-direct one but at this point my seat was already reserved. I was told that this was 'impossible' and that if I didn't check-in in DC my whole flight would be cancelled. What I understood was that the customer service department is simply unwilling to help their guests. I will never fly with this company again.
10271,US Airways,11-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,This airline is the worst my husband and I have traveled before. He is on a business trip and since the beginning they are delaying and delaying the trips. All his flights had been delayed going in and out of Memphis. He couldn't get back today because his flight was so delayed that he lost the connection with another 12 persons. It took them 2 hours to schedule another flight for the next morning and instead of giving him his original flight to Harrisburg they sent him to Chicago to guess what delayed the flight again because they change planes for mechanical problems. They don't respect the schedules.
10272,US Airways,9-May-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,April 24th red eye from SAN-MSP via PHX. Little to complain about flight-wise were pretty close to being on time and no issues in-flight. Got the dreaded ZONE 5 for our boarding pass and my wife was nervous about having to gate check her carry-on (the last thing you want to do after a red eye flight is wait around at the airport for baggage) but there ended up being plenty of room.
10273,US Airways,8-May-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,Traveled several times over last 5 weeks with this airline. No major gripes with any flight. Most recent trip CLT to LaGuardia Flight 2064 May 1 and return Flight 1851 May 4. Delays first trip which could not be helped due to problems in NY. Captain very informative of what was happening. Friendly crew. Trip back no delays. Informative Captain and very friendly crew. Only gripe CLT check in staff need to up their game a lot. New York staff very helpful and friendly.
10274,US Airways,6-May-14,UK,0,Economy,3,NO,Flying from London Heathrow to San Diego via Philadelphia. On check in was informed of slight delay but told to go through anyway. Once through security clearance boards showed 7 hours delay on flight. I went to Customer service desk to ask what would happen about connections or overnight accommodation at Philadelphia as it seemed likely that I'd miss any connections that day. Customer service agent told me they had no idea when the flight would actually leave but that of course they'd honour the connection as it wasn't my fault and that it would all be worked out once we were airborne. She could tell me nothing because she had no information at all. So I decided to make use of the otherwise wasted time working on my PC in the executive lounge. About 2 hours later the flight disappeared from the display boards. I went back to the customer service desk to find it closed! There was a sign giving a phone number to call - which I did the person on the other end told me she couldn't book me on to any alternative flights - somehow I was too late in the queue and all available seats had already been allocated and she expected me to be pleased with the fact that she'd booked me onto the following days flight 24 hours later. No offer of overnight accommodation or transport back home overnight. When I asked about my bags she told me to ask at the ticket desk the other side of security (ie landside rather than airside). So I exited the departures area back to the check-in area only to find the customer service desk closed with a sign up saying anyone affected by the flight cancellation should call the number I'd already been talking to. On checking in again the following day there was no hint of any apology for the disruption. I asked about getting an upgrade by way of compensation and was told that was not permissible - though I could ask at the ticket desk (though by that time I had already been allocated a seat). This was the first time I had tried US Airways and looks like being my last.
10275,US Airways,2-May-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I've flown twice in the last month with US Airways and I have to say never again. Their customer service is terrible. Every flight was late. No explanation. On my most recent flight from Washington to Portland Maine I missed a connection. My layover was 2 hours long so I thought there would be no problem. But after a delay following a delay following a delay I missed my connection. The first thing the US Airways representative told me and he was a manager was that I should fly Delta. A couple of weeks earlier I was flying from Washington to Portland and we had to set down in Philadelphia because the captain told us the door wasn't shut properly. Now I know there are a lot of jobs to do before flight can take off but I think shutting the door properly should be in the top two or three on the list. The mix of arrogance in this organization baffles me.
10276,US Airways,30-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Connecting flight out of Charlotte supposed to take off at 10.11pm delayed until 11.30 due to no crew - get boarded only to have to defuel for over an hour. Then the mechanical problems started for another 2 hours so 3 hours sitting in the plane at the gate - only to get deboarded. It is now 3am no explanations no water no snacks. Get reboarded at 4.30am - sit for another hour - get deboarded yet again! They say they have until 10am to cancel the flight. If they don't cancel you will pay for any other flights. There aren't any flights until the day after tomorrow no hotels either. Airport/airplane for 10.5 hours past original flight time. Instead of being apologetic and nice they acted like they were doing us all a favor by letting us sit in our seats. Another US air flight was cancelled earlier in the evening due to mechanical issues as well - guess they were tired of dealing with us.
10277,US Airways,29-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,CLT-HAM. We take this trip every 2 years. I will never fly US Airways again! My story is very similar to everyone else's. They cancelled my first flight delaying our arrival by 1 day. We couldn't leave from our original location told to drive 3 hrs to Charlotte. Then they overbooked our rescheduled flight. They seated my family (children) in all different areas of the plane. They had no vegetarian options for one of us therefore she was starving on a 8 hour flight. They made an error on our return flight. Lost our luggage. Directed us to the wrong gate in PHL. When we arrived at the correct gate the attendant would not let us on the plane and she refused to help rebook our flight. We had been traveling for more than 20 hrs.
10278,US Airways,28-Apr-14,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,12 April 2014 Departed LHR flight no 729. Flight was 1 hour late taking off due to aircraft not being ready for passenger seating cleaning and food availability. Inflight entertainment was average seating as expected for economy class food was satisfactory but as a vegetarian I do not find it acceptable that the airline had run out of vegetarian options. I then had to wait a while for a vegetarian option to arrive. Landing was smooth arriving an hour later than scheduled meant there was not enough time to complete customs and security checks. Upon arriving at customs we were greeted by a spiralling queue of extremely anxious passengers customs were unable to manage the large quantity of passengers this resulted in us waiting for more than 1 hour no provision made for late arriving passengers to be fast tracked through customs to allow us to board our connecting flight. We were reassured that the flight would not take off without us. We ran to the gate displayed on the departures board and when we arrived at our gate we were disappointed to find that the flight had taken off without us. We waited to speak to a customer service representative for over 2 hours. We asked to be put on the next available flight and got no response was booked onto 10am flight the next morning. I asked where we would stay for the next 12 hours staff member shrugged. We walked away from customer services feeling so disappointed. We spent the night in the airport. Decided to approach customer service again totally different attitude and approach. Given a freshen up bag put us on standby for the 6am flight to Orlando. We arrived at the gate patiently and we were lucky to be boarded on this flight. Finally arrived at our destination 12 hours later. Luckily our baggage was waiting in the bag claim office. I would never fly with this airline again.
10279,US Airways,28-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"My husband and I were on our first day of our honeymoon traveling to Cancun. We boarded the flight in Charlotte NC to leave at 1.20. We sat there on the plane in separate areas from 1.20 until 3.30 waiting for the numerous ""15"" minutes of repairs they had to do. After finally waiting over 2 hours they started taking the luggage off without informing the attendees the flight was going to be cancelled. We waited another 15 minutes or so and they announced the flight was cancelled. We waited about 40 minutes in a long line waiting to catch another flight which they couldn't get us out until the next day in the middle of the day and we had to go back through security. So not only are we paying for a day of our all inclusive resort that we will not be at but now have to pay for food and everything. This was supposed to be the best day going on my honeymoon but it has been a nightmare."
10280,US Airways,23-Apr-14,Germany,0,Economy,1,NO,"Not only are US Airways employees rude they also are simply not willing to provide any sort of customer service and are not responsible for people missing their flights. I flew to San Juan from PHL and a return flight over PHL to NYC. My 4-year-old and I were seated 15 rows apart on a flight from PHL to San Juan and I had to wait in the aisle for 30 minutes until somebody was kind enough to let my daughter and I sit next to each other. On our flight back from San Juan to PHL the lady at the desk seated my daughter and I 5 rows apart on the connecting flight from PHL to LaGuardia. I did not realize this until 5 minutes later and went back to the same lady. Her answer - ""Oh just ask one of the passengers they'll switch seats with you."" The flight from San Juan to PHL was delayed because of ""bad weather conditions"". When we got to PHL an hour late our connecting flight to LA Guardia in NYC had already left. Another rude US Airways employee gave us tickets for a flight the next morning and as already mentioned above told us they would neither help find transportation nor a hotel. Because of their guidelines they would not release our luggage so now we are in NYC where we got at 4 am. US Airways have no customer service."
10281,US Airways,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,We were on our way home from San Francisco to Salt Lake City and we had a one hour layover in Phoenix. When we got to San Francisco we had already got the call that our flight was delayed 35 minutes. We tried to get on another flight but none were available. When we were checking in it was very hard to get some help because for some reason the kiosk let myself check my bag but not my friend. It took a good 10 minutes to get any help and we just kept getting walked past. Got to the gate and the plane ended up being delayed for 50 minutes now. When we got to Phoenix we had 5 minutes to get to our next flight. Turns out they changed the gate last minute and instead of only having to go from gate A10 to A12 we had to go from about A20 to B2 in 5 minutes. My friend and I sprinted from our gate to get to the next one and we arrived with one minute before they close the doors (since they close them 10 minutes before departure) The door was closed and there wasn't a sole around. I went to the next gate and I explained our flight was delayed twice and there was a last minute gate change. Very rudely she told me she was aware and then went back to talking to her friend. The customer service agent was not helpful at all as well and was very rude. No one apologized and we had to stay in Phoenix that night because no more flights were going out until 7am then next morning. I will never fly with US Airways again.
10282,US Airways,20-Apr-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,ORD-PHL-YQB (Quebec City). A320 to PHL - maybe only 45 people on the plane so boarding was quick and we departed the gate early. Flight Attendants were very personable and not what I usually get on US Airways. Maybe the merger with AA is a good thing. Drink service was offered and otherwise FA's walked the aisle a few times for trash. Landing was smooth and great views of Philadelphia. Bus transfer to commuter gates - its strange that if you want to walk to that concourse you have to recheck through TSA but they have a bus transfer that keeps you within security. YQB flight was a CR7 and packed - but FA was nice. Left 20 min late but arrived just 1-2 min late. Overall a nice flight. I know they don't offer inflight entertainment but so many people have their own Ipads and Ipods and such - its not that big of a deal. Keep up the good work.
10283,US Airways,18-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,US Airways is the worst. Their flights out of New Orleans are oversold so if you don't check in at least 30 minutes before your flight you will be bumped. I tried to get my boarding pass from the computer about 28 minutes before departure time and it could not be done. I spoke to the agent and they said that I had to rebook to another flight. I begged and they said no. They put me on a later flight and I go through security and my original flight was still at the gate for 20 minutes! They had already given away my seat and I couldn't board. Zero customer service. Horrible for business travel. I will go out of my way to avoid US Air.
10284,US Airways,17-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I was on a trip with my 5 year old son from NY to AL. We arrived at the gate of our connecting flight in Charlotte NC just as they were closing the gate although we were there 10 min prior to takeoff. I explained that we were flying down for a funeral which we would miss if we were delayed. The gate attendant told me I was 30 seconds late and not getting on the flight. My return flight was delayed 1.5 hours and the connecting return flight sat on the runway for 45 minutes. It appears that exceptions to delay are only made when it is to benefit their company and not for their paying customers. I will never again fly US Airways!
10285,US Airways,17-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew to the Dominican Republic from Detroit 4/4 with a stop in Philadelphia. First flight 40 minutes late had to literally run with 2 kids through the airport to make our connection in Philly. Didn't realize there was no need to run because that flight was delayed also. Boarded 45 minutes late sat on the plane for 30 minutes at which time they made everyone get off the plane. Sat in the waiting are for another hour while they attended to 'broken seats'. Flew home on 4/10 - flight delayed in DR for 1.5 hours with no explanation. Only had a 2 hour lay over in Philly where we also had to go through immigration and customs. Again we managed to make our connection only because the flight from Philly to Detroit was late again. That's 4 flights - all delayed. Don't you think if you have 20-30 passengers who are on the verge of missing their connecting flights that they would have those people get off the plane first? They couldn't have cared one iota. I will never fly US Air again nor would I recommend it to anyone. I can't rate the Inflight Entertainment because there wasn't any. A 4 hours flight and no entertainment of wi-fi?
10286,US Airways,16-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,US Airways Express: They decided to cancel an express flight from Philadelphia to Newark due to a lack of people and have the next one 3 hours later. I have completely lost all confidence in US Express and recommend no one to fly this airline again. They also refuse to compensate travelers due to their incompetence.
10287,US Airways,16-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport to Honolulu Hawaii and returning from HNL to PHX. US 690 and US 693. March 24 2014 from PHX to HNL. April 1 2014 return to PHX from HNL. Having read the most recent reviews for March and April flights thought I would add mine. US Airways has been calling themselves American Airlines for many years. This time there was a 1.5 hr delay going to Hawaii due to mechanical problems. Every time I have flown with US Air there has been long delays flight cancellations you name it. Why did we fly again? They were the cheapest.
10288,US Airways,14-Apr-14,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,I flew RT last week BDL-CLT-RSW. On-time flights courteous gate agents and flight attendants and helpful ticket counter people. I was surprised as the (for me) usual mediocre experience was actually much improved.
10289,US Airways,12-Apr-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Flew US Air A330-300 from Rome (FCO) to Charlotte (CLT). Honestly I wasn't excited about having been assigned to this flight/carrier. Once on the aircraft there was a noticeable change from its US domestic counterpart there was personal AVOD at each seat head with ample choices for the long flight the seats had ample leg room and appeared wide and comfy. The flight crew were friendly and quick to please and even did a walk through picking up trash that had accumulated on the deck (rare for a US carrier). The international product that US Airways offers has left a positive impression and I won't be hesitant to fly this airline in the future. The A330-300 was spacious and smooth in flight.
10290,US Airways,10-Apr-14,UK,4,Economy,3,NO,Flew overnight from LAX to Philadelphia. Despite logging in on-line and assigning seats together a week or so beforehand and checking on the day of the flight my wife and I ended up at different ends of the cabin which wasn't really how we wanted to spend our honeymoon. The check-in staff were essentially useless fobbing us off onto the gate staff. At the gate they were friendly but it was too late to be able to sort anything out by that stage. Eventually we were able to swap seats with the person next to my wife after she took pity on us. The actual flight was rather miserable with no entertainment food and uncomfortable seats essentially like doing a long haul flight but on a budget European carrier. Certainly will avoid them in US Airways in the future.
10291,US Airways,9-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"I have never experienced such rudeness as I did with the US Airways personnel at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. I had booked my redeye flight from PHX to EWR nearly 3 weeks in advance. I chose a window seat. After checking in to my flight at the airport I realized I was assigned a middle seat. Since I had arrived 4 hours before departure I was the first person at my gate. The gate agent was curt. It was almost time to board there was still no gate agent to be found. 80% of my fellow passengers myself included found out through word-of-mouth of a gate change. I grabbed my belongings and ran from A18 to A25 eager to restore my original seat assignment. However I had hardly introduced my situation before the new gate agent cut me off and said ""Sorry no room."" The customer service agent could not have been more indifferent and reluctant to do her job. I went back to my gate where my flight had been delayed more than 2 hours. There was yet another unannounced gate change. Finally it was time to board. Despite sitting in the 13th row I was in the last boarding group and thus was forced to gate-check my bag which now reassured that I would be late to work in the morning. This experience ruined the weekend."
10292,US Airways,8-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,Probably the worst airline I have travelled on in 10 years. Service was bad. Connecting flights didn't connect and uncaring employees. They don't get that it is all about the customer.
10293,US Airways,7-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Terrible service terrible equipment semi-friendly staff who can't help because of terrible organization. Baggage charges are ridiculous. Check-in procedures worse they have to have attendants at the self check-in. They claim to be the New American Airlines but when you go to check-in they send you to the Disaster that used to be USAir. Planes are out of date. Even the newer ones have very small overheads for carry ons but people take as much as possible on board. Then they cram as many possible on the plane. Flight from Hawaii has no service. Expensive food if you have to buy from them and not worth it. We had short connection and no chance to buy in airport. Only good thing I can say about round trip flight with 6 connections is we made it safely. Next time I fly Southwest.
10294,US Airways,7-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My wife and I live in NC near Wilmington. US Airways is one of the few airlines that fly out of ILM airport so we have flown with them numerous times. My wife flew to Ohio for a two week visit. The return flight as it was listed on the flight itinerary was to fly from Cleveland OH (CLE) to Charlotte NC (CLT) have about an hour lay over and then fly onto ILM. The flight was supposed to be into CLT on flight 1955 and out again on the same flight an hour later. This seemed odd since US Airways typically lands at one end of CLT and has you fly out of another gate all the way across the terminal. We questioned this flight into and out of the same gate when we purchased the tickets when she went to board her flight in ILM to go to CLE and again in CLE when boarding to return. All three times we were told that was accurate. The flight from CLE was delayed due to weather for 35 minutes and landed in CLT about 50 minutes late. People were scrambling to make connections as this was the last flight of the day (about 11 pm). My wife made a comment to one of the flight crew that she was lucky since she just had to stay on the same plane. The staff member told her that plane wasn't going anywhere for the rest of the night. US Airways had changed her flight plans while she was in the air. The flight she had to catch was only 8 gates away but it had already boarded and was pulling away by that time. She was stranded in CLT for the night. I ended up driving the 3.5 hours one way to pick her up to save her from having to sleep in the terminal. I would highly recommend that if you have any options other than US Airways for making flight plans you do it. Even if you have to pay a little extra for a ticket the peace of mind will be worth it.
10295,US Airways,4-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,"The second leg of our outbound flight was cancelled. We were given the option of flying the next two booked flights standby or cancelling and applying for a refund. We chose to apply for a refund and the person at the customer service counter said we'd need to wait until our trip was completed. I received an email regarding our outbound flight that I needed to contact customer service because our reservations were ""out of sync."" I spent 25 minutes on hold getting that straightened out and the person told me I should go online and print out our boarding passes. I could only find my husband's flight. I called back and was told that was because I had new confirmation number which the prior person didn't give me. I went back online and found out we were no longer sitting together. I called back again and was told I could pay extra for a premium seat otherwise there was nothing they could do. She told me the gate agent would be �happy to help.� That conversation took an additional 30 minutes. When we got to the airport and I asked about sitting together and the employee was very rude saying she would ""try to get us together for this 20 minute flight."" I explained it was the second leg I was asking about. She got us closer but not together. She could have put us in a �premium�seat together but would not without us paying additional money. At no point during this entire encounter did any U.S. Airways employee apologize for these inconveniences or for the conflicting information I have been given."
10296,US Airways,2-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Travel was a nightmare on our return vacation from Jamaica. I have a daughter with Down Syndrome and needed seating together with my wife and daughters. let's just say they were less than helpful in getting us seating together. When I pointed out that it did not seem like they were sorry about not doing their job they threatened to remove me from the plane. What kind of an airline treats a family traveling on vacation like this. This was only the first leg of the trip when it came to the second leg and catching our connecting flight they could not find our tickets and we missed our connecting flight home.
10297,US Airways,1-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"I have flown over 20 times in my 23 years and never have I experienced any of the problems I had to deal with my first time flying with US Airways. After boarding our flight on time we proceeded to sit on the tarmac for nearly 2 hours. The pilot informed us that there were ""operational"" problems and they were making him turn the plane around to go back to the gate because our flight was cancelled. After the rush of everyone to customer service we proceeded to stand in line for 45 minutes. At that point one of the three agents they had behind the desk decided that would be the best time to grab her book and go on break. The agent who decided to actually do her job put us on a flight to Jacksonville (3 hours from our original destination - Tallahassee). Never once was there an apology or offer to provide meals or anything. I had checked my bag in so I made sure to reiterate to her I needed my bag re-directed. She assured me my bag had been re-directed. We proceeded to sit in the airport for another 4 hours. Our plane to JAX was late so the agent hurried all customers to the plane. Finally we got on the plane and landed in JAX at 10.15 pm. My bag was not there. After waiting in line until 11 pm to speak to an agent about I learned that my bag had never in fact been re-directed and this agent's ""best guess"" was that it was still in DC."
10298,US Airways,31-Mar-14,UK,1,Business,0,NO,Flight from Manchester UK US735 to PHL to BWI on 16th March 2014 by Envoy and First Class service was excellent outbound. Good meal and Envoy was excellent. Return flight from BWI on 28th March cancelled and taken by vehicle to PHL 1 hour 40 mins. Flight US 735 PHL to Manchester UK. Checked in at PHL no problem and the Club lounge very nice per check in at gate confirmed our seats in Envoy. Prior to boarding saw three employees of US Airways access the plane before boarding called. When boarding announced we joined the line to check-in however told that whilst my wife was checked into Envoy I had been bumped back to coach as the flight was full as a person who missed a flight on previous day was being placed into my seat! Re assigned a coach seat despite my request to remain in Envoy. As I asked more questions the reason for my downgrade (despite confirmed and paid for Envoy seat) changed over and over again. Basically I was not provided with the correct reason and was just treated with no respect. As I was pulled from the line much embarrassment to me as people assumed some issue with me as a passenger. My wife confirmed that the three US airline employees were in Envoy. Appalling service and ruined what was outbound a great service. If this is the way they treat passengers than not much hope for the new American brand.
10299,US Airways,26-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"We flew to St. Maarten an hour late. On the return trip the plane was late to SXM which made it late for us to board. Then the ""push back"" machine did not work and we were stuck on the tarmac making us an hour delayed in leaving SXM. We arrive at Charlotte and had to wait on the tarmac for an hour because there was no gate for us to deplane. The pilot told us that US Airways was holding our connecting flight. We hitched a ride on the airport transport and arrived at our connecting gate barely on time. They closed the door and would not allow us to board. Our connecting plane was not held as the pilot said but left 10 minutes before its scheduled departure. US Air offered us a discount on a hotel since there was not another flight out until the next day. We protested and refused to leave their desk. Finally they gave us a voucher for a hotel. We finally went out on a packed plane and made it to our destination. I will look for any other airline in the future for our trips."
10300,US Airways,26-Mar-14,Germany,8,Business,4,YES,FRA-PHL-FRA. Envoy. The new seat is excellent. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks and wine ok. Entertainment great. FA`S typical American style but they did their best. Both legs on time nothing to complain about. From my point of view a very good experience.
10301,US Airways,24-Mar-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,The express jets with no first class seats need to be taken out of service - these planes are entirely too small in poor shape and if anything ever happened there is no way to move to get out. US Air flight attendants (not all ) but many have the personality of a rock - they need education on customer satisfaction and customer service they need to understand that the service they provide is what matters most. And do you think they could offer a free bag of peanuts? Delta does! Get with the times US air - you are outdated.
10302,US Airways,25-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,We flew JetBlue to San Juan Puerto Rico - no problems or delay. Coming home through Philadelphia to Richmond VA 3/22/2014 was a disaster for several reasons. U.S. Airlines from San Juan was an Airbus 330 and we waited for 50 minutes on the runway while every puddle jumper took off which made us within 15 minutes to get our 7.15pm flight to Richmond VA. We landed in concourse F and had to get to concourse A and get a transfer bus. No help from the airline ground staff to expedite or help us. They seem oblivious to our situation and offered no help. They were rude and non caring.
10303,US Airways,24-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"Had made reservation early January for flight to Phoenix on 2/26/14. Boarded on time but then proceeded to sit on tarmac for 2 hrs. Flight was then cancelled due to ""mechanical problems"". They gave us along with 175 other passengers a business card with an 800# to call. After trying for almost an hour I was finally connected and given a flight out the next day. No offer of hotel meals or anything else. I then went to customer service at airport who booked me to Philly (yes Philly). With a long layover and then to Phoenix. Arrived at 10:15pm rather than the 8:15am I was originally scheduled for. Customer services is absolutely horrible. Return flight 2 weeks later was also cancelled supposedly due to weather. No offer of help whatsoever. Will never fly US Air again."
10304,US Airways,24-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,We were flying from Jamaica to Nashville. We arrived at our connecting flight 20 prior to departure and the had given our seats away to standby customers and shut the door. We couldn't get another flight for 2 days.
10305,US Airways,21-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My entire trip was horrible. I am active duty military with both feet injured and surgery boots on. I asked for wheelchair assistance round trip. Starting in LAX the curbside check in guy was extremely rude he was on his phone and when asked for a wheelchair the man looked me up and down and asked what was wrong with me. I got through security and was wheeled to my gate the lady who wheeled me there assured me someone would push me to my airplane. When they started to board they forgot about me and had people climbing over me finally someone saw me and wheeled me half way and left me to talk to a group of passengers in front of me. Once they finished they came back and began pushing me to the airplane. Once I landed In Charlotte the flight attendant was extremely helpful getting me off the plane however once I got off the experience was even worse so many rude people asking can I walk because they need the wheelchair for people seeing I am in two medical boots. I informed them that I was unable to walk long distance so they took my wheelchair and told me to walk to the closest seat so they could take mine! This was a horrible experience and I will never travel with US Airways again.
10306,US Airways,17-Mar-14,USA,2,Business,2,NO,Firstly when will US Airways get new planes. We fly Business Class cross country with no music or entertainment of any kind. Really they can't play a little music. The seats are so old and pushed close together if the people in front recline back we can't stand up. If you're in the back row your seat doesn't recline back at all. Food is sometimes just not edible once we were sitting in the last row and were informed they had run out of food before they got to us. I asked if we could get a meal from the coach section they said no. They found some cheese and crackers for us. The crew tries to be accommodating but they don't have much to work with. All that aside it's the old planes that upset me just update the fleet please.
10307,US Airways,7-Mar-14,UK,10,Business,4,YES,MAN-PHL. The new seat is excellent - so much better than the BA sardine tin. Food was nicely presented and of good quality. Drinks free-flowing though wine selection limited. Easy going flight attendants who worked hard and interacted well with passengers. A most enjoyable experience - much better than the BA equivalent in every way and cheaper.
10308,US Airways,7-Mar-14,Canada,7,Economy,4,YES,Vancouver to Phoenix Feb 27 return Mar 2. On time both ways pleasant service no problems. One cart service per leg. Frequent updates from the flight deck. No mess no fuss.
10309,US Airways,7-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,LGA to IAH with connection at Charlotte on March 1st. Both flights departed on-time and arrived early. Check-in boarding went very smooth and I managed to get exit seats on both flights. Cabin crew professional. Only negative point was that the cabin looked tired and not very clean. Hopefully their aircraft's will be refurbished as they merge with AA.
10310,US Airways,6-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,2,NO,"My husband and I travel to Belize and Mexico 2-3 times per year with relatively little issues. I have never in my entire 42 years had such a horrible experience as I had on 21st Feb with US Airways. Our flight departed Pittsburgh at 5.25 am with no issues and we were to switch planes in Philadelphia to pick up flight #815 to complete our trip to Cancun with a 10.49 am. arrival. There was heavy fog in Philadelphia so we circled the airport for some time before being diverted to Harrisburg. Sat on the tarmac in Harrisburg for several hours with no one telling anyone anything. Around 10 am they finally taxied us to the airport and let everyone deplane. After standing in line for more than an hour a staff member told us we needed to grab our bags and get on a bus as they were going to drive us 2 hrs to Harrisburg. Arrived at the very end of the drop off zone at the Philadelphia airport at 2 pm had no idea where we were or what we were supposed to do. We managed to beg a TSA agent who hustled us through security and we ran to the gate. Got to the gate just after it pushed off so we missed the flight. An hour later we found out that not only were we not put on the next flight we couldn't even get a flight until 10 am the next day. We asked if because we missed an entire day of vacation and were out the additional cost of a hotel as well as the cost of having to reschedule all of our transportation arrangements at our final destination if we could switch our return flights from Friday to Saturday and we were told ""Of course you just have to pay the change fees"". Any amount of basic common courtesy would have at least made some kind of difference in this entire situation."
10311,US Airways,5-Mar-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,March 2014: My flight from Washington DC to California had a lay over in Phoenix AZ. My 9.30 pm connecting flight got delayed then cancelled due to rain. However they didn't tell us this information until a long time after it already showed up online as flight being cancelled. The rude customer service staff at the airport were rescheduling probably 150+ flights told us that there were no hotels available or lounges. They did not give us any water food (restaurants were all closed) or blankets. We sat in the cold airport all night (over 11 hours). We were not allowed to get to our luggage unless we had medication we had to take. I fly a lot but this is my first and last time flying US Airways. I have never experienced such disorganization inept and rude customer service representatives and overall horrible service.
10312,US Airways,5-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,PHX-JFK return connecting to AA international flight in JFK. Both US flights on time and exactly as expected. Both flights on time service (drink run) multiple times through each flight. Wish they would update the announcement to delete the star alliance portion as they will be exiting EOM. Also feel the onboard announcement for the credit card is tired and should be discontinued.
10313,US Airways,4-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I recently booked a return flight from LAX to Charlotte. I paid top rate as it was an emergency. Nothing about this airlines wants you to use it again. On my return flight I paid extra to sit in an aisle seat in a designated area. I had hoped the extra $$'s would at least give more space but no such thing. At the last minute they added people from other delayed flights. They put a woman with an infant in the seat next to me and someone with an infant behind me. There were plenty of single last-minute passengers they could have put in these seats but no they put them where we all paid extra to sit. I was practically pushed out of my seat during the entire 5 hours by a fidgeting Mom and infant. Both infants cried non stop for 75% of the trip.
10314,US Airways,4-Mar-14,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,LAX-PHX-PDX and return last week. All 4 flights departed and arrived relatively on-time all legs on A321 aircraft. Staff were friendly and attentive but not quite as polished as UA/DL. Star Gold gets you zone 1 boarding which is nice - but that will go away at the end of March as they leave Star Alliance and switch to oneWorld. IFE non-existent but fine for short hauls. They got me from point to point with no frills.
10315,US Airways,4-Mar-14,Canada,0,Economy,1,NO,Booked our flight in August 2013 for Toronto to Philadelphia on Feb 15 2014 06.45. Checked our flight status the day before our flight. Everything is good but noticed 2 flights to Philly scheduled at same time. Again I checked flight status before going to bed the night before flight. Everything was good. Woke up early (2am) next morning to prepare to go to Toronto airport. Checked flight status one more time. Our flight is cancelled but other flight to is still a go. Got to airport 2.5 hours before flight time. US Airways kiosk would only printout a baggage receipt no boarding pass. Talked with US Airways rep who said the only flight to Philly was overbooked. Got stand-by boarding passes and waited at the gate for a miracle to happen. Five minutes before our flight was to board we received seats. We somehow managed to make it to our Philly connecting flight and on to our Puerto Rican cruise. If at all possible I will not fly US Airways again!
10316,US Airways,4-Mar-14,Belgium,2,Economy,2,NO,I flew from Brussels (Belgium) to Fort Lauderdale and back on 16th Feb and 24th. I was supposed to take connecting flights via Philadelphia and Charlotte on both trips. I actually missed my first connection on my way to FLL due to the long security lines the customs control and the baggage re-checking in PHL. I arrived just a few minutes after my flight to CLT had closed and a very rude lady didn't want to let me board the plane even though it was still sitting at the gate. She directed me to the customer service desk in a rude manner. I still made it to FLL by boarding a direct flight in the evening thanks to the professional US Airways customer service lady that rebooked me straight away. I didn't have any problems with my connecting flights on my way back to Brussels. US Airways have poor cabin crew service very limited in-flight entertainment (operated by old Boeing 767s). I have read many reviews about this airline before flying with them and I was expecting to have some problems. I would not recommend this airline to someone traveling in the future.
10317,US Airways,25-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Yesterday morning we began our return flight to central New York from a lovely vacation in Orlando. We boarded the first leg to Philadelphia without incident around 7.30 am. As we were preparing to land a crew member announced that Philadelphia was fogged in and not allowing any craft to land or take off. After 30 minutes it was announced that the plane was being diverted to Richmond for refuelling. An uneventful 45-minute flight and then it was announced that there was some trouble refuelling. Another hour on the tarmac and we took off for Philly. Upon landing we made our way to the regional terminal to continue our trip to Ithaca which was still posted as &#8216;on time. The boarding was switched from gate to gate 3 times. Our departure time was changed twice and finally the flight cancelled. We stood in line at a US Airways gate and told to go to a service desk for help. We stood in line a long line for another 30 minutes at the service desk to be met by a staff member who told us that she could get us standby on a flight Monday (this was Friday at 3 pm.). The customer service representative offered nothing other than a 3 day wait. There were many things that could have been done to make the experience right. Ground transportation offer of a hotel a little compassion but what we got was nothing no help at all. We will not fly US Airways again.
10318,US Airways,25-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"This review is based on the first and only experience with US Airways. I usually fly 4-6 times per year and would not hold the airline responsible for weather related delays. Unfortunately the airline is not prepared to handle emergencies of any kind. I was supposed to fly February 14 to Costa Rica flight was cancelled as I was proceeding to board due to ""mechanical issues"" rescheduled to Sunday. I lost 3 days of vacation without reimbursement. Coming back on February 23rd my connecting flight from Costa Rica was delayed by 30 minutes. The airline refused to accommodate or even hold the connecting flight. I had to go through Customs recheck the bag and run to anther terminal all under 45 minutes. I arrived at the gate 10 minutes before scheduled departure time panting only to find that my seat was given up to someone else and was I rebooked to the following morning. The Customer Service at US Airways handed me a number for the hotel very nonchalant since it was the end of her shift and she was ready to head home. I on the other hand paid for the cab checked into a hotel at my own expense. Customer service is completely lacking."
10319,US Airways,24-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I travel a lot for work and always take Southwest. I live in AZ and usually have to fly to east coast / Midwest during bad weather and have never had an issue with delays or the staff and they give you snacks. This time I had to fly using US going to NY and the day of my flight leaving (2/21/14) the weather was warmer just a little rain and some fog. Every other flight was on time but US. A flight that was to leave at 4.30 and was now not leaving until 8. Horrible service.
10320,US Airways,24-Feb-14,USA,6,Economy,3,YES,I recently flew on February 15th from Boston to Providenciales (Turks and Caicos). I found this airline to be good on time boarding staff were very good. They came around with beverage service and then tea and coffee about an hour before landing in Turks. Coming back to Boston yesterday was a disaster I know it's school vacation week but the service at Providenciales Airport was extremely slow almost causing us to miss our flight to Boston. The service onboard yesterday's flight to Boston was minimal. They only came around with beverage service once. No service for tea and coffee. It was though a quick flight and the pilot made up travel time in the air after our brief 1 hour delay leaving Turks and Caicos.
10321,US Airways,24-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I flew US Airways on a round-trip from Birmingham to Denver. Both flights were cancelled or delayed for several hours. When trying to change my flight they put me as a second priority and were incredibly rude to me. I will never use this airline again and I strongly advise everyone else not to use it.
10322,US Airways,24-Feb-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,We flew from PHL to St. Thomas and back on US Air on Feb 15 and returned on Feb 20. We paid extra for what we thought was economy plus but there was no more leg room than in coach. Of course US Air has no inflight entertainment. There was not enough food for purchase on the way down. Flight attendants urged us to complain to US Air on the net about it. Flight attendants were great and very apologetic about the lack of food. On the return flight we were about 3 hours late due to a mechanical problem. I fly United Delta Virgin America Jet Blue and US Air a decent amount. No question that Virgin is by far the best followed by JetBlue. Of the remaining 3 Delta is better than the other two with US Air on the very bottom of the list.
10323,US Airways,20-Feb-14,USA,10,Business,5,YES,BTV to PHL to CDG and return Airbus A330/200 on the long haul. Despite snowstorm at BTV departure was only 25 minute delayed remainder of flights on time departed CDG earlier than scheduled. Business class on the A330 Envoy seating. Clean cabin friendly professional crew. Envoy suites were excellent quiet and comfortable IFE worked great. Food service was excellent nice menu entrees were delivered almost too hot to eat. Ground crews at both ends were friendly and helpful our luggage beat us to the carousel both times. Boarding area at CDG is a little drab could use a little facelift.
10324,US Airways,20-Feb-14,UK,10,Economy,4,YES,Flew Manchester UK to Philadelphia and then on to Miami return - Economy. Very good experience on all 4 flights. All flights left on time and either arrived on time or early. US Airways use A330 wide body from Manchester to Philadelphia with 2-4-2 seating which is great for couples as you can easily get 2 seats together. US airways website lets you choose your seats as soon as you book for free unlike lots of the other major airlines (e.g. BA) which charge economy class to pre book seats. Plenty of leg room and space around seats. Great inflight entertainment on Manchester to Philadelphia leg with personal video screen and on demand movies TV and games. Lots of films to choose from. Food ok - usual airline offering. No better or worse than all the rest. Soft drinks tea and coffee are free throughout the flight. Free wine with meal but there is a charge after that plus there is a charge for other alcoholic drinks. Staff attentive and efficient. Flight from Philadelphia to Miami on A321 - lots of leg room but no IFE - only a couple of hours so no problem. No charge for soft drinks/tea/coffee but there is a charge for food or alcohol. All in all a good experience - would always use US airways from Manchester to the US rather than American BA United or Delta as IFE superior and they use wide body aircraft. Immigration/customs and change of planes in Philadelphia is easy and quick.
10325,US Airways,20-Feb-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,"We were booked from LAX to CLT. Flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues. We were rebooked out of a different airport. No transportation costs were provided or refunded. We had preferred seats on our first flight reserved and confirmed but then when rebooked we were assigned middle seats. Even though there were other seats available US Airways refused to give us other seats even with Star Gold. status. Inflight crew were yelling at passengers getting on board about the carry ons we were questioned from FA about our carry ons even though we only had 1 backpack each. One drink service on a 4 hours flight. Flight crew decided to chat loudly in the back galley on this red eye flight. I hope that American Airlines doesn't adopt the US Airways policy of ""useless"" air."
10326,US Airways,17-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,As an EP with American flew US Airways from TPA to PHL on 1/10/2014. The seats are terrible American offers free food and drinks to their Elite Passengers but US Airways does not. As an EP with American for 10 years this is one of the worst airline that American merged with. US /American CEO Doug Parker needs to take care of AA Elite Passengers or they will fly United or Delta.
10327,US Airways,17-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Flew from Providence to Charlotte. Going in I was very optimistic that everything was going to be fine and we would land in St. Kitts the same day. I was wrong. When we got to the gate we were kindly informed that our flight had been delayed 4 hours because the ""crew needed more rest."" They also informed us that we were going to miss our connecting flight to St Kitts from Charlotte and that we wouldn't be able to catch a flight until next Friday to St. Kitts as they have very limited booking. After switching to another airline entirely we got a flight to St. Kitts the next day and we were on our way. Once on the U.S. Airways flight to Charlotte the captain informed us that they ""knew the flight would be delayed the night before."" If U.S. Airways had informed us the night before instead of a half an hour before our flight was supposed to leave then we might've been able to get another flight to connect to the flight to St. Kitts. This has been by far the worst performance of customer experience I've ever seen."
10328,US Airways,17-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Had a flight out of JFK during a snow storm. Our flight was canceled after waiting through 3 different mechanical issues and 11 hours. We boarded the same plane 2 separate times over 8 hours and were offered 1 glass of water. My trip home was delayed 24 hours with no hotel voucher given causing me to miss a day of work. US Airways offered $100 voucher for my troubles! I would have been ok with a weather delay considering the snow storm but mechanical? 3 on the same plane? Then continued mechanical delays on three other planes through connecting flights.
10329,US Airways,13-Feb-14,USA,9,First Class,4,YES,Flew from Boise to Indianapolis via Phoenix. All flights left and arrived punctually. Attentive flight attendant. Good food service. Good selection of drinks. Cabin spacious with light colored furnishings - Airbus 320. Seat comfortable. Quick boarding and disembarkation. Regular announcements by pilot about weather on route. Overall very impressive.
10330,US Airways,10-Feb-14,USA,4,Economy,4,NO,"Flight from FLL to CLT. (2 times A320 and 737) Flight was on time crew friendly. Plane extremely uncomfortable. I am average male 5'10"" 150lb. No legroom seats narrow and short. I hope US Airways works on pax comfort in the future."
10331,US Airways,7-Feb-14,USA,7,Business,4,YES,TPA-PHL-Rome over Christmas. Treated myself to 1st/Biz to Europe but took Economy back. Unpleasantly surprised by the rushed unfriendly service in first cabin to Europe. there weren't that many flight attendants (mostly men) and they were all in a hurry and don't seem to like their jobs much. The new lie-flat bed was great though small - bigger folks beware. Fook was OK. was glad I didn't bother to spring for biz class on way back. Economy is OK.
10332,US Airways,28-Jan-14,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,Was traveling from DC to Hartford on 1/24/14. Flight to DC was coming from Jacksonville FLA - no weather problems in either JAX/DC/CT. The DC departure to CT was over 2 hours late. To make matters worse the plane from DC to Hartford bumped anyone off sitting in rows 19 and beyond. Imagine waiting to board a plane and then due to your seat # - told you couldn't board but that there was another flight 6 hours later!
10333,US Airways,23-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,We used a travel agency to book our flight Fresno to Mexico City. Our seating was confirmed we paid extra for selecting our seats. At check-in we were told that we would be charged $25 for using a 27 inch suitcase instead of a 21 inch suitcase. Then they wanted to charge us another $95 for being 6 pounds over in weight. We had to run and buy a backpack for the items we took out. Then asked to see our passports and told our return flight was changed from the afternoon to early morning and we: my husband and 2 daughters were scattered all over the plane. I was told they could change the seating in Mexico on our return flight. In Mexico City on our return home to Fresno CA arrived at the airport asked about changing back our seating to the original seating arrangement everyone said they could not help me. They only changed my seating to sit next to my husband. When they rescheduled our flight our arrival time in Phoenix was at 11am and or boarding time to Fresno was at 11.20 am. and when I voiced this concern all I was told was that we had better run.
10334,US Airways,21-Jan-14,USA,0,Business,1,NO,Took my twin 6 year olds and 2 year old to Disney from Boston with a stop in Charlotte NC. We were delayed by a late plane that then had to be de-iced. An hour and 1/2 after our scheduled departure I asked a crew member for some milk for my baby's bottle. The elder of the 2 grouchy crew members said we don't have milk! The 2 year old screamed for most of the flight. We had a connecting flight in Charlotte due to leave 5 mins before our new arrival time. No information was given to anyone. We finally get to our new gate (B8 Charlotte about 7pm on 1/18/14). We were treated like misbehaved school children. They put us in 4 seats that were spread across the plane. I was met with a glare and an attitude. Onboard was not much better. Service and attitude poor across the board with this airline.
10335,US Airways,21-Jan-14,Australia,9,Economy,4,YES,We took US Airways flights earlier this month ORD-CLT-ILM round trip. Pretty happy with them. Short flights&#8230;but check-in was a pleasure (we got stuck overnight Chicago due to a late connecting flight and bad weather and US airways gave us a voucher for a very reduced rate at a local hotel and re-scheduled us for the next day - no charge. Check-in staff at ORD and ILM excellent particularly ORD where they spent a lot of time trying to find alternatives for us no luck - terrible weather and flights beyond full. Aircraft's have done some hard work but still pretty comfortable - leather seats enough legroom. Cabin crews were helpful and friendly - regardless of age.
10336,US Airways,16-Jan-14,USA,2,Business,2,NO,"January 15 2014. Flew from Palm Springs to Portland with connection in Phoenix. Connection was ""legal"" with 28 minutes from first flight touchdown to door closure on connecting flight. Of course the flight in was in a separate terminal so the time to get from one gate to the other was a 30 minute ordeal. Needless to say of the 4 passengers that were to connect none made it. When I arrived at the connecting gate after running across the entire Phoenix airport I was greeted by a very non caring gate crew. They immediately asked me if I was connecting from Palm Springs and when I said yes the gate rep just said that the flight was closed and I have to take another flight. I asked if they knew we were coming in from Palm Springs and they knew the plane had landed and they knew we were all coming from about a mile away then why on earth would they not hold the door an extra ten minutes. This is their scheduling screw-up not mine. The lack of apology and talking to us as if the whole thing was somehow our fault just puts a bad taste in my mouth."
10337,US Airways,13-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,We sat on the tarmac for an hour got into the air only to be told there was a mechanical error. Flew in circles around the airport for 4.5 hours (longer than my actual flight) to burn off fuel were treated rudely by staff and no beverages were offered the entire time. Our rescheduled flight was for 7.30 am the next morning and when we arrived it said it was on time for 8.45am. When I asked they said that even though it was late it wasn't really their fault so even though it was over an hour late it was still considered on time. They then double booked my grandfathers seat and tried to move him out of first class. On our way back we sat in line for 3.5 hours to check in because the system had crashed and the flight was delayed 2 hours just so that they could check everyone in which meant I almost missed my connecting flight. I am currently waiting on my bags the next day. I am never flying US airways again.
10338,US Airways,13-Jan-14,UK,8,Economy,4,YES,LHR to Philadelphia. Good catering. Very full flight. Pleasant cabin crew. Touchscreen was a bit unresponsive at times but all in all not bad for 8 hour economy flight. Unfortunately ended up with a middle seat.
10339,US Airways,10-Jan-14,USA,6,Economy,3,YES,We flew from Philadelphia to Dominican Republic round trip. Overall it was a good experience though the airline needs to do a lot to improve their inflight service.
10340,US Airways,8-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,I flew from Denver to Charlotte to get a connecting flight to Jacksonville NC. The Denver flight was delayed 1.5 hrs due to maintenance therefore I missed my connecting flight they rebooked me for another flight but I had to stay the night in Charlotte but gave me a hotel voucher for a booked hotel. The flight from Charlotte to Jacksonville was also delayed due to maintenance. Moral of the story US Airways has horrible planes that always need maintenance. Don't fly with them unless you want to be late or miss every connecting flight.
10341,US Airways,3-Jan-14,USA,10,Economy,3,YES,I recently flew U.S. Airways from Denver to Boston MA. Although I had to change my flight from one day to the next and pay an extra fee for the change the flight was very comfortable. After I arrived in Boston I knew that my bags were MIA. I had recently flown from San Francisco to Denver and they sent my bags to Washington D.C. even though I never made that flight but since I was scheduled to be in Boston I had to travel knowing I didn't have my bags. I was very pleased with Susan at customer service in Boston. As I arrived she promptly assisted me in locating my bags. She was also extremely pleasant to me as a customer. Needless to say because of her my bags were returned and I will definitely be flying U.S. again!
10342,US Airways,3-Jan-14,Canada,2,First Class,1,NO,This has to be the worst airline I have flown on and I do travel a lot. Our recent supposedly first class flight from PVR to YVR started late in PVR due to technical difficulties. A two hour 10 minute flight in first ranks a cardboard cup of coffee and a bag of potato chips! The second leg was delayed due to technical problems then when ready to leave a drunken passenger had to be removed on the insistence of a passenger (the attendant said he knew he was drunk but not how much) and then the plane developed a mechanical problem necessitating a plane change. 4 hours late and what did first class passengers get for their now 7 plus hour trip-yes you guessed it a bag of chips and a drink. They should be banned from Star Alliance Membership until a new experienced in customer service CEO is hired. Clearly this is the fault of the Executive not the cabin crew. By the way no inflight entertainment and the seat in front of me was broken.
10343,US Airways,2-Jan-14,USA,5,Economy,2,NO,I flew in November 2013. Rarely have I experienced such stressed out miserable flight attendants. Their unhappiness changed the tenor of the entire trip. There were no unusual conditions with the trip. We had a packed flight but we weren't running late and passengers weren't making any special demands or causing problems. The attendants' facial expressions body language and polite curtness spoke of barely held in tension. In addition to that passengers were herded onto the plane managed like we were an inconvenience (again politely but still the feeling was there) and the plane itself was dirty. While US Airways is offering some good flight deals I don't feel inclined to fly an airline where the staff are clearly not happy with their jobs. Additionally US Airways needs to beef up their efforts to provide a great experience for their customers.
10344,US Airways,2-Jan-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,Multiple frustration with seating arrangements we (fianc� and I) purchased our ticket a month in advance and were later told that we would be together. Found or seating arrangement a week before the flight and seated separately. No customer service would help. When boarding I was holding my tablet in hand my back pack and wheeled baggage. They got on my case about my tablet that I was only allowed a carry on and personal bag. Told I would need to put my tablet in the bag. Or check in one of my bags. They were dead serious that they wanted me to step aside and put my tablet in my carry on or else have to check-in my bag. Seats were cramped and I'm a slightly small framed individual.
10345,US Airways,2-Jan-14,USA,6,First Class,0,NO,Traveled from Long Beach to Phoenix and then onward to JFK Airport on red-eye flight. This flight left much to be desired as everything from the hard to soft product are abysmal. Domestic first seats are unbearably uncomfortable to sleep in with the angle recline only going down about 3-5 inches. As for the on board amenities free alcohol and few select chips just doesn't cut it though they do offer meals on non red-eye flights from what I've been told. It gets even better as the sad excuse of a blanket they provided for sleep was a thin fabric that can easily be mistaken for as a table cloth. Club access in Phoenix was granted with *G and much like the flight it left a lot to be desired as well - stale crackers unappealing soup and choices of free and paid drinks. Positive to flight was that staff service is fair and ground handling was par. As a star alliance traveler I really wished there was a better alternative to traveling domestic US.
10346,US Airways,31-Dec-13,Italy,10,Economy,4,YES,I flew from Italy to Pittsburgh (via Philadelphia) on Nov 14 2013 with return on Dec 28 2013 via Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On my return flight to Frankfurt (A330 plane with IFE at seat) I felt very dizzy and was about to pass out halfway into the flight. The flight attendants in Economy promptly assisted me and checked on me every 10 minutes to see how I was feeling. Their attentiveness and concern were much appreciated especially as I was traveling alone. What's more the US Airways staff in every airport (Venice Philadelphia Pittsburgh and Frankfurt) were courteous and professional. I have absolutely no complaints with this airline and will fly with them again.
10347,US Airways,31-Dec-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,We flew from Denver - Phoenix - Puerto Vallarta on 12/25/13. Denver to Phoenix was ok. In Phoenix the female gate attendant was very rude stating we must check our carry on bags. On board several open spaces in overheads. Puerto Vallarta-Phoenix flight was ok. Phoenix-Denver flight was the same rude female supervisor again had to check carryon bag. FA's are rude and act like they are along just for the ride. This is the first and last experience with this airline.
10348,US Airways,31-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew on 12/24/13 from SYR to PHL to GSP - worst experience due to USAir's inability to publish a flight schedule with connections that could be met and PHL HUB employees not having enough knowledge of alternative airports and airlines. Additionally all personnel I spoke with at PHL or on the phone looking for assistance were very very rude.
10349,US Airways,29-Dec-13,Mexico,5,Economy,2,YES,I flew from Guadalajara to Phoenix then to San Jose (GDL-PHX-SJC). In Guadalajara boarding was on-time and take off also on-time. We arrived to PHX at the scheduled time but we only had 1 hour to catch the next flight to SJC we lost it because immigration queues were too congested. The staff of US Airways was perfect they re-booked the tickets and we had to wait 4 more hours in the airport. When we were finally onboard the next plane (both Airbus A320) we had to wait 40 more minutes. Arrive at SJC 1 hour delayed.
10350,US Airways,23-Dec-13,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,PHL-SJU-PHL. Although I generally have a negative image of this airline I must give credit where credit is due. Both flights were on newer A330's with very polite and attentive FA's and both flights departed and landed on time despite snowy conditions in Philadelphia . The one complaint I have is that the IFE was not turned as this is only provided on transatlantic flights - how much exactly does it cost US Airways to turn on a system they already have installed in the aircraft?
10351,US Airways,23-Dec-13,USA,8,First Class,4,YES,Flew Fresno - Phoenix - Orlando 3 day trip. Last month flew Fresno - Phoenix - Charlotte. Last trip was a nightmare because of delays - mechanical resulting in missed flights and a flight crew on the last leg that seemed to not be too concerned with the delay given it was late at night. Anyway booked again. This time first class. Good experience. First leg out operated by Sky West. Flight attendants - two of them talking loudly all the time. Were attentive to passenger needs. Hopefully will be more sensitive given that some of us had been up since 4 am to get ready for the flight. Rest of the trip was great. Bottom line flight crew is key to a positive experience. Will fly US Air again.
10352,US Airways,21-Dec-13,Turkey,8,Economy,4,YES,DFW to LGA via CLT. All flights went smoothly. I was a little nervous since we left Dallas 30 minutes late and had only 20 minutes for the connecting flight to LGA. However flight to LGA boarded passengers from the same terminal that we arrived from which was very convenient (arrival and departure gate was right next to each other) My luggage also made it despite short connection time in Charlotte. I kept tracking my bag by using their iPhone application as well as the flight status while in the air. Crew members were extremely polite and offered more than one round of soft drinks and coffee. My only criticism would be their boarding policy. I was group 2 on the first flight but group 5 on the final flight even though I was sitting in the front section of the cabin. I received Star Alliance partner miles within 5 days into my account.
10353,US Airways,17-Dec-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I've been flying US Airways for nearly 3 months. Four flights per week for a total of 48. Nearly half of them have been delayed due to some sort of mechanical issue. These issues always take much longer than the expected amount of time to the point that I have missed 10 connections in that period. Two weeks ago I flew IAH to CLT to see my flight to SAV was delayed by 30 minutes then 1 hour then cancelled without explanation. Customer service offered a flight at 9 pm 12 hours later. In fact I'm currently on board a flight to CLT that cannot depart because the plane has had ice for an hour and a half. Rather than moving to have the plane de-iced at the north end of the airport they attempted to fix it with a heating truck then a second one. The crew has been unsympathetic throughout and I'm frankly tired of it. Unfortunately I'm not in charge of booking my business flights. But for those that have the option I would suggest avoiding US Airways if you intend to ever arrive on time.
10354,US Airways,17-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,When I checked in I checked with the agent to make sure that the plane was not delayed and that I would not be running in to weather issues. She assured me that it would not be a problem because of my flight time. So I made no arrangements to rebook anything. That quickly turned out to be a lie. We started with a delayed flight out of DFW 1.5 hours delayed while we waited on the plane to be de-iced. We finally arrive with passengers that had connections to Richmond and Denver. Due to the delay our planed landed 5-10 minutes too late to make the connection. Both planes were still at the gates. But instead of holding the planes by 5-10 minutes which by the way would not have caused any disruption of service because all of the planes that had connections were the last flights of the day. Instead a conscious decision was made to deliberately force all of the passengers to miss their planes and have to incur hotel food and transportation expenses. I was one of the first passengers to be turned away. The gate agent was still at the gate the plane was still at the gate but she said they had shut the door and I was stuck for the night. I then got in line and was stuck on the next flight and sent on my way. The next day I get to the gate. It is a full flight and everyone in group 4 and 5 are told they can only have 1 bag or personal item. I checked with the agent and made sure that it was okay for me to have my laptop bag and my shopping bag. Then at the gate I was told that I could not take my laptop bag. Instead I had to take both of my laptops out check my laptop bag and then crush my designed hand bag and pastries by cramming them under the seat with my unprotected laptops. It seemed like every step of the way every agent of USAir intentionally tried to make this the worst possible trip possible.
10355,US Airways,17-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I purchased two round trip tickets on USAirways for travel from DC to Orlando FL for the Thanksgiving holiday. We were unable to use the ticket for flight from DC to Orlando and U SAirways canceled our return tickets from Orlando to DC. I found this out when I tried to check in online for the return flight. We had to rent a car and drive from Orlando to DC because our tickets had been canceled.
10356,US Airways,17-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I feel that there is simply no excuse travel on a transcontinental flight and be served no meals except the horrible choice that you are given and have to buy. Airlines should be required to serve at least one meal without charge when you are flying all of the way across the USA! On the way back on the last leg of my journey back home to Newport News Virginia we were not even served water!
10357,US Airways,16-Dec-13,Greece,1,Economy,2,NO,Booked my flight AND free seat selection (8E) on 6/9 for my flight to PHL on the 15/11/13. At check in they gave me seat 24 which was the worst though 8E had been confirmed by US Air. They said that they have no obligation to provide the confirmed seat of my choice! Strongly complained to supervisor via phone and asked for aisle seat for my return flight on the 8/12/2013. He said plane was almost full and the best he could do was give me an aisle seat row again 24. Plane was 1/3 full practically empty and at PHL airport I was given row 12. Inflight service both ways far below average no comments on food. This airline in no way can compare with European airlines and this was my fourth disappointing experience with this company.
10358,US Airways,9-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,I flew from Honolulu to PHX and PHX back to Honolulu. I was very disappointed with this airline my first impression was horrible. Going to PHX from HNL the flight attendants on US airways were very rude and unprofessional. The aircraft that services HNL is always the 757. It was very squashed no wifi 3 by 3 seating configuration on the left and right side thus no room to move around. The interior of the plane was falling apart tray tables did not at all stay in the lock position. Lighting everything seemed out dated. Meal service was horrible you have to pay for meals where as on Hawaiian Airlines all meals are complimentary. Coming back from PHX to HNL flight attendant and customer service was very outstandingly rude. We were delayed 1 hour because we had to wait on a US air flight attendant who was late. This is unacceptable.
10359,US Airways,9-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My son had a very expensive round-trip ticket for Thanksgiving break: Spokane to Los Angeles with transfers in Phoenix. We confirmed the flights online. We tried to check in at the airport on Dec 1 for the return flight at least 30 min early (6am). My son had only one carry-on and a backpack. Theoretically he could use the automatic kiosk to get his boarding pass and go directly through security. They had already sold his ticket. The woman behind the counter wasted our time. It took 10 more minutes to call the supervisor. They were rude and told us we should have been there 45 min early. They gave my son a standby ticket for flights when the Phoenix transfer was at 9pm with no chance of getting aboard. That would mean he would be sitting at the airport from 6am to 9pm! I had to pay a change of flight fee $225 plus $250 for the next day.
10360,US Airways,4-Dec-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,My two young kids and I flew US Airways over the thanksgiving holiday. All four of our flights were on time and the connections were all within the same terminal which was a plus. The staff were friendly on every flight as well. On our last flight the airplane didn't have enough seats due to a smaller airplane than expected so all the passengers in the last ten rows had to be put on different flights. It was obviously an inconvenience but they did a phenomenal job handling it. They immediately put us on another flight that was leaving at the exact same time got an airport cart to take us to our new terminal gave us each $200 vouchers and delivered our luggage to our home. They were so kind and apologetic what more can anyone ask for!
10361,US Airways,3-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"On Columbus Day Weekend from MYR to LGA through CLT the first flight was scheduled to leave at 2.23 then from CLT to LGA at 4.30. When I got to the airport at Myrtle the lady at the counter told me my flight was not leaving until 4.50 because of a ""mechanical error."" I received no notification or email. She put me on a 10 pm flight to LGA without my consent. This is absolutely unacceptable for an airline. She refused to tell me that there were earlier flights available so I looked myself and found a flight on Delta which left 3 hours earlier. The staff at US Airways are so unsympathetic and simply do not care about the customers. I recommend flying any other airline unless US airways is your only option. The flight attendants refused to apologize for this too. Never again on this airline."
10362,US Airways,3-Dec-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Our flight from Flagstaff to Phoenix was canceled due to fog and our second leg was rescheduled for 12 hours later without ever getting in touch with me to have my permission for this move. I drove to Phoenix to catch my second flight and got there on time but was not able to get on that flight because they already gave away my tickets. Mind you economy class over $2.5k for 2 tickets and then you get pushed around whichever way! I wonder whether you just turned around and ripped someone off to sell my tickets and then reschedule me for an overnight trip! Not to mention that the rest of the service was not that hot either. The person on the phone was not so polite or helpful in addition. Really a huge disappointment US Airways!
10363,US Airways,29-Nov-13,Ireland,3,First Class,3,NO,I started flying with US Airways a few years ago when they offered competitive business class (envoy) fares from Ireland and received a Dividend Miles Gold Card from them two years ago. On 9th November 2013 I flew first class on an internal flight from Tampa to Charlotte. I had to pay $50 to spend one hour in the US Airways Club in Tampa airport a lounge that does not offer a shower facility. The fact that I was flying first class and holding a US Airways Dividend Miles gold card was irrelevant to the staff at the reception desk there. I will never fly with US Airways again.
10364,US Airways,29-Nov-13,USA,3,First Class,1,NO,We flew with one-stop from Boston to Phoenix and then Phoenix to Maui Hawaii. Each leg of the trip was about 6 hours so we splurged for 1st Class assuming it would be more comfortable and have full amenities one would expect at $1 300 per seat (one way). Pulled out my headphones but found nowhere on the seat to plug into? Was told there were no music TV movies or other entertainment options. Wi-Fi was offered at a price but it still would not allow for any streaming services so what's the point? Staff were polite and matter of fact. Meal was mediocre even for airline food. No complaint with the beverage service they realize it's the best way to medicate you. We eventually had 3 each and fell asleep. We had about 40 minutes between flights and they didn't announce the gates for connecting flights at the end of the flight as many airlines do for their passenger's convenience. On the ground in Phoenix we learned that the gate for our second flight to Maui was clear on the other side of the airport so we hurried with our carry-ons to the far end some 30 gates away. As soon as we got there they announced a gate change that flight which required us to rush right back across the entire airport again to the gate area where we had started at!! Everyone already at the gate bolted for the far end of the airport along with us. Insane. Even Jet Blue economy is a better flight experience. We will never use this airline again.
10365,US Airways,27-Nov-13,USA,6,Economy,4,NO,"Nov 21 MOB-CLT-ORD. CR7 from Mobile to Charlotte. Flight boarded on time and left 15 minutes early. Flight attendant was nice and let everyone sleep as it was a 6am flight. Landed on time and long walk from Concourse E to B for connecting flight. A321 to ORD - boarded and flight attendant at the door had her back to the door so wasn't greeting anyone. Then the next FA as you walked into the coach cabin was on here cell phone and either ignored the passengers coming in or waved them a ""hello"". Totally unprofessional and rude. Flight was packed but left on time. Smooth flight and comfortable seats - limited service from FA's. Really will be interesting to see what happens with the merger with AA."
10366,US Airways,27-Nov-13,USA,3,Economy,3,YES,I experienced delays inbound and outbound. In cabin satisfaction is dependent on the crew. Flight back to SFO captain reported 2 tyres needed to be changed. Should be done in 15 mins comes back with 20 min extensions for total delay of 60-90 mins. No inflight beverage service. Never experienced this on other flights. Good for the crew they got to sit out. Delayed arrival because of mechanical issue. Flown many times. I would describe myself as a non complainer on flights so far as I have accepted the decline in service in general.
10367,US Airways,27-Nov-13,UK,9,Business,4,YES,Manchester UK to Fort Lauderdale via Philadelphia. Trans Atlantic in Envoy A332. Great seats and meal was excellent. The service is not to BA or Virgin standards but was never the less very good. Lounge stop over at Philadelphia was very good and economy trip to FLL on an airbus A321 nice flight with good seats. Return FLL to PHL on an Embraer 195 first time on this plane and very good experience 2 plus 2 seating in economy. Club Lounge at PHL was an excellent oasis although not a patch on BA or Virgin lounges. A332 in Envoy for trip back to UK was great again although staff on this flight not as good and the food served was lukewarm and attention to detail was lacking bread offered after you had eaten the main course! Breakfast omelette and sausage was good. Overall a great Enoy experience once again I do hope that Envoy brand is retained when the AA/ US merger is complete otherwise I will miss the US Airways experience as I can honestly say I have never had a bad flight with them and I have had quite a few.
10368,US Airways,27-Nov-13,UK,6,Economy,3,YES,LGA-CLT-SDF-CLT-LGA with the CLT-SDF segments operated by express carriers. I was worried about the short transit times and the vast CLT RJ complex but it more or less worked out. Departure from SDF-CLT was on a day with miserable weather but US made it out and I made the connection with maybe 1-2 minutes to spare. The LGA terminal is really a pleasure to use with short lines and a nice amount of space near the gates. Staff service was good throughout. Only problem is the lack of BOB even on the mainline flights - just offering nuts and chips is not enough during lunch time and with short connections there's not really any other choice!
10369,US Airways,25-Nov-13,UK,10,Economy,3,YES,Flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia with a connection to Florida. Flights were on time the planes (A330 and A321) were clean modern and the staff on board and on ground were welcoming. The food on board was actually really good! The on-board entertainment was very good other than the touch screen wasn't very responsive but no big deal! Having read reviews I was quite apprehensive about travelling with US Airways and honestly I couldn't fault them. Pleasant flight lots of stewardesses offering drinks food etc. Would gladly use them again.
10370,US Airways,18-Nov-13,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,Having logged hundreds of thousands of miles world-wide I would rank my recent experience with U.S. Airways be in the top two of my worst travel experiences. Oakland - Phoenix - New York - Phoenix - Oakland. Eastbound Oakland and westbound New York flights were both late departing (the latter by more than one hour). Nearly missed my eastbound Phoenix connection and actually did miss my westbound connecting Phoenix flight due to late departure from NYC. My Westbound flight took nearly 11 hours from NYC to Oakland. I could have flown to Europe in that amount of time (less actually). Promised meal eastbound was not provided after all. Dinner consisted of a bag of pretzels. Bad news overall.
10371,US Airways,18-Nov-13,Italy,7,Business,3,NO,MIA-PHLin business class: the seats were nice and spacious however didn't seem particularly clean. The service was OK but nothing special almost surly. PHL-VCE in business class: we had to wait to be airborne before the inflight entertainment was switched the headphones and the TV screens installed in the individual cradles. Once that was done the selection was rather limited. The service was OK the attendants did what they had to do but there was no enthusiasm in what they were doing overall above all considering that the plane was half empty in both classes. The food was actually tasty and well presented. The seats a bit temperamental to begin with and then not too comfortable: they didn't flat out completely so not too conducive to sleeping. The lounge in PHL was nice but the food selection there was extremely limited surely if compared to other StarAlliance lounges around the world.
10372,US Airways,25-Nov-13,USA,6,First Class,3,NO,I was in 1C on a US Airways A321. The flight was a little over 5 hours which was too long to be sitting in this seat. The seat was worn out and reclined about as much as coach. And seat 1d was completely broken. The meal was average and the service was poor. I would never pay for these seats and would only sit in them if I got a preferred upgrade.
10373,US Airways,18-Nov-13,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,I flew from Newport News Virginia to L.A. with a connecting flight in Charlotte. The plane left Newport News about half an hour late and so it looked like I would miss my connecting flight. But I ran all the way from gate E to B9. I arrived at the gate to see that the plane was still taxied and attached to that little bridge walkway to board the plane. It looked like I made it but when I tried to give my boarding pass to the lady she very coldly told me I was too late. I tried to plead my case in a calm and rational way but was told that the next flight was in an hour. It was actually in 2 hours and when I called her out on it she just smirked.
10374,US Airways,15-Nov-13,Canada,10,Economy,4,YES,Been flying US Airways for a couple years now and have had nothing but the best of experiences. I base my review by comparing it to my experiences with other airlines - they are in my opinion the most organized airline. My goal when flying is to get from point A to point B and be somewhat on time. With US Airways my flights have always been as scheduled. Seats are a bit more spacious than with other airlines too. I could not care less if the staff had a smile on their faces or not. Maybe they are like us and are having a bad day every now and again.
10375,US Airways,6-Nov-13,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Flew from San Francisco to Jacksonville FL. Flight crew acted like they hated their job never smiled once poor leg room and no onboard amenities except a glass of water or coke. At least Delta gives you a cookie. Pay extra for JetBlue they have by far superior service.
10376,US Airways,5-Nov-13,UK,8,Business,5,YES,LHR-CLT-CMH-PHL-LHR. Transatlantic legs in Envoy Suites domestic in First. Was really very pleasantly surprised with the whole trip. The Envoy suites are very comfortable fully flat and private (particularly if you get the individual window seats) and are in fact very similar to AAs new business class flat beds on their new B777-300s or Qatars B787. However the US Airways seats are clearly a more budget version with smaller TV screens etc (but just as comfy for sleeping). Reasonable selection of films and the food was not bad at all. Excellent value- Booked less than a week before departure and this was the same price (slightly less in fact) as a full price Premium Economy fair on BA so absolutely no competition and would choose again without hesitation.
10377,US Airways,5-Nov-13,USA,6,Economy,3,NO,"October 29th �Boston to Charlotte flight 657. Do you have any idea how rude the ""customer service"" representatives are in Charlotte? I have had two separate experiences with them in the past couple of months and I am just dumbfounded by it. We approached the Customer service desk where 3 employees were virtually filing their nails. They didn't say hello they didn't smile. They weren't helpful. It was almost like they were aggravated to have to deal with us."
10378,US Airways,5-Nov-13,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,I have been flying for over 50 years and I can honestly say that my recent round trip flight on US Airways from Los Angeles to Tel Aviv was the worst airline experience I have ever had. The first leg of this trip was from Los Angeles to Philadelphia when I got on the plane I looked around to plug in my earphones to hear some music but the stewardess informed me that this flight did not have any way to either listen to music or watch a video. In addition all food had to be purchased. The second leg of the trip was a 12 hour flight from Philadelphia to Tel Aviv. The TV screen on the back of the seat in front of me did not work and when I told the steward he attempted to fix it but he was unsuccessful consequently I sat in a cramped seat for over 12 hours with no music or video. When they served breakfast there were two choices: eggs or blintzes - I asked for eggs but I was told that they were out of eggs and when I asked the steward to check the other aisle to see if there were any eggs left he became angry. Unfortunately the blintzes were covered with a sickeningly sweet jam which made them inedible. I will never fly US Airways again.
10379,US Airways,1-Nov-13,USA,6,Economy,3,NO,Flew BNA-CLT-PVD. Overall I had good flights and didn't really experience any problems myself but the airplanes themselves are old and you can tell in the interior. Gogo wireless was a nice touch but it wasn't always reliable and was also a bit pricey - $17 for a day pass? The fact that they overbook bothers me. I saw families get bumped in CLT and didn't think that was a good business practice; only giving folks a $300 voucher for it isn't really helping their case though I suppose it's better than no voucher.
10380,US Airways,26-Oct-13,Switzerland,2,Economy,2,NO,We will never fly US Airways again after this experience. The first three legs of our journey were OK - average service but on-time arrivals but the last leg was a nightmare. Our flight was cancelled after a 4-hour delay and while cancellations happen to all airlines the way US Airways handled this one was appalling. Gate agents could not operate their own ticketing system to rebook passengers baggage was delivered two hours late and to a carousel in a different terminal and US Airways employees had no idea what was going on and were generally indifferent to passenger needs. We were traveling with an infant yet were given a hotel 15 minutes away when there was another hotel connected to the airport that other families received. Overall just a complete disaster in terms of customer service.
10381,US Airways,23-Oct-13,UK,5,Economy,2,NO,We flew GLA-PHL on time with good service then the PHL-MCO connection was delayed due to a crew member being late 30-45mins delay. After a wonderful holiday in Orlando checked in at 11.30 in good time for our 3.05 flight to PHL then went through security and to the gate departure screens said our flight would be delayed to 4.20 so it would not arrive in PHL until 18.20. Told we would miss our connection to GLA leaving at 18.40pm. They told us that the problem was another crew related issue! They rebooked us on plane departing PHL at 21.55 and arriving LHR at 10.00 the next morning then book us on a British Airways flight to GLA leaving at 12.10 arriving at 13.55 we would have originally been in GLA at 7.00 am but did not arrive till 14.00pm. When questioned US Airways said that there compensation policy is to just rebook passengers ASAP on the next flight available. The plane going from MCO-PHL an A330 did not have any inflight entertainment on this route despite having seat back TV's. That happened to be the same plane taking us to LHR but on that journey there was in-flight entertainment. So would not use US again unless desperate and would not recommend. Otherwise BA gave superb service on their flight and would defiantly recommend.
10382,US Airways,23-Oct-13,USA,0,First Class,1,NO,PHL-PBI was the last leg on my first-class round trip to and from PSP. I had boarded USAir in Palm Springs that morning and flew to Phoenix. So far so good. Then I flew Phoenix to Philadelphia. That's where it all fell apart. I was stranded at Philadelphia airport by US Airways when their last flight of the day departed early leaving 3 connecting passengers abandoned. Dealing with the brick wall that is the US Airways customer service staff my treatment was shameful disrespectful and costly. USAir refused to rebook me because my reservation had been made via United Airlines. United told me that since my reservation was a First Class Mileage Award the first compatible seat they could rebook me on was next Monday (5 days hence)! Consequently I had to put myself up at the Sheraton in Philadelphia for the night and pay $508 to buy a one-way ticket from PHL-PBI. Adding insult to expensive injury the flight I was supposed to take was first-class non-stop. This one-way rip-off ticket was in coach and had a layover in Charlotte. On just this website alone and going back only about 8 weeks I have encountered reviews of no less than a dozen passengers who have been stranded or treated miserably in Philadelphia by USAir. Coincidence? I don't think so. It is my belief that when an airline accepts your ticket to get from point A to point B that it assumes its share of responsibility for getting their passengers to their destination. I had already flown 2 out of the 3 legs of my flight that day. Departing early and stranding three connecting passengers is unconscionable.
10383,US Airways,23-Oct-13,UK,6,Economy,4,YES,Flew from PHL to DEN round trip Oct. 17 returning Oct. 20. Upgraded on the flight to Denver and coach returning to Philadelphia. Both flights were on time and just as importantly the cabin crew were professional and overall did a good job. On the flight to PHL there was a medical emergency and the crew kept the passengers informed - as much as they could - regarding what was going on. Overall good experience. People complain there's no IFE on US. Bring a book or your tablet to watch a movie.
10384,US Airways,23-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,My 92-year-old father flew from Denver to Asheville NC and when we got to Denver there was a guy at the ticket counter who helped my dad with his ticket luggage and wheelchair. He could not have been nicer or more helpful. The lady who came with the wheelchair was a nice and patient as she could be with him. He reported later that all personnel with US Airways were very attentive and helpful in getting him through the airport. They may have been bad in the past but this time they were the best airline I've seen.
10385,US Airways,21-Oct-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Flew GLA-PHL-MCO and return. Excellent in every way Seats and legroom were good food was the usual economy food but does me fine check-in was quick and simple staff pleasant and flights on time what more can I ask for. Only down side was the video screens I was in window seat and couldn't see it properly but didn't bother me that much really. Would fly with them again no problem.
10386,US Airways,21-Oct-13,UK,9,Economy,3,YES,LHR-CLT-TPA-CLT-LHR. All flights left on time flights on the international leg is an A330-300 which is a good aircraft 2-4-2 seat configuration large seat back screens for showing a good selection of movies. TV shows games etc seating was ok with good legroom on all the flights. My only complaint is the food both ways the offering was chicken with rice or pasta surely they can come up with more choice than this also a muffin for breakfast is not much to offer. One other gripe I have but this is not exclusively US airways but all American carriers why are passengers allowed to take such large baggage in the cabin some suitcases were bigger than mine that went in the hold. Generally I was pleased with the service I got on all flights and would use US airways again for future travel.
10387,US Airways,21-Oct-13,France,6,Economy,4,YES,"BCN to JAX rtn via PHL. Philadelphia Airport seems to come in for a lot of stick on this forum but you can only speak as you find and my wife and I found it a very pleasant improvement to the likes of JFK MIA and LAX as regards transfers. More space and less like a cattle market. Paid to go in the US Club which was very pleasant and well worth twenty odd dollars. Only waited 5 mins to clear immigration which is far less than anywhere else we've encountered in the States. As for US Airways well we've now been on all of the ""big four"" in the last couple of years (first time with US) and to be honest I really cannot see any difference in any of them. In all four in economy space is getting tighter and tighter and food/drink on offer is getting less and less and poorer and poorer quality. But if people want low fares then there's the rub I guess. At least US run modern planes (A-330 200's) on this route with Emb 175 on the domestic sector far better than poky CRJ's etc. The Airbus is far better than the triple sevens or the ancient 747s or 767s used by some and at least if you are travelling as a couple you just get two seats and don't have to share. AVOD in all seats which is better than many. Overall still miles behind people like Air New Zealand but they are only of any use if you want somewhere out West. In short as long as you don't expect luxury from any of these American giants you won't be disappointed. I'm getting to regard them as a bigger Ryanair ie just a cost effective way of getting from A to B."
10388,US Airways,21-Oct-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Horrible customer service. Slow staff and tight connections don't mix. Not accommodating or apologetic whatsoever for missed flights in a tight connection they allow but shouldn't if the whole process of getting from one flight to another will take so long. Closed the flight early with no announcement that I could hear as I was rushing to the gate. They knew I wasn't on board and my bag was or wasn't. Probably had plenty of standby passengers to take my place. Waste of time. Fly a real airlines and don't bother with these dinosaurs.
10389,US Airways,19-Oct-13,UK,1,Economy,2,NO,So many bad points that I'm not sure they will all fit! 1) Do not pay for 'preferred' access. I forget exactly what the name is but I paid$ 31 for this in order to board the airplane 'early' but was told by the attendant that it didn't mean anything just go by the zone number. 2) The food ran out and I was told I could pre-order but when I tried to do this for my return flight I couldn't as the website only listed the food but there wasn't a way to actually order and pay for it. 3) This has already been said but the seats are extremely uncomfortable. I purchased seats by the window so I could lean against them to sleep as I had to travel from the UK to AZ. In total I paid an additional $267 for these seats but I shouldn't have bothered as the space between the seat and the window was so far that I couldn't lean against it at all. 4) The return plane 'broke down' and so we had to wait approximately 4 extra hours this was at night and the airline graciously gave us a $10 voucher for a meal while we waited but the voucher was only good for shops in the airport but it was so expensive all I was able to buy was a bottle of water and a bag of chips. 4) Because of the plane braking down I was going to miss the coach (bus) in London that would take me home and I had already paid for it. I will never travel on US Airways again.
10390,US Airways,19-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Flight from OAK-PHX-PIT. Wasn't supposed to change planes in PHX but they changed that. Took my boarding pass in OAK and refused to reprint one in Phoenix told me that's too bad for you and ""not my problem"". Fortunately I printed two and the gate attendant snarked at me saying ""well aren't you just smarter than the rest of us!"" Continued on to PIT and requested a Kosher meal since I'm lactose intolerant. What do they bring me? Ham and cheese!"
10391,US Airways,17-Oct-13,UK,7,Economy,5,YES,PHL-MCO 15 October 2013 on 757. Very tired plane could do with an update but the airline have got new planes on order so it maybe replaced. Service ok. Nothing special but did what was required. Cabin crew very pleasant. Happy to recommend. Only downfall no IFE.
10392,US Airways,17-Oct-13,UK,8,Economy,5,YES,MAN-PHL 15 October 2013 on an A330 great plane. IFE good with good selection of programs and movies etc cabin crew very attentive and very pleasant. Would be happy to recommend. Meals very good we had a vegetarian and kids in the party and all where catered for very well.
10393,US Airways,16-Oct-13,Canada,9,Business,5,YES,Flew from Halifax to Philadelphia to Dublin return. Regional jet from YHZ. On-time with the normal drink service. An older 767 from Philadelphia to Dublin in Envoy. Good service wonderful meals- likely the best airline I have flown for the quantity of food - you are not left hungry. Choice of 4 meals and a hot breakfast choice too. On time and overall good. Return to Philadelphia on the same aircraft in Envoy. Really great service and food was outstanding. Philadelphia to Halifax on a new Embraer and very comfortable. Overall this airline does a great job in my experience (this was my second trip to Dublin this year with them). And a very nice touch with the menus being in English and Gaelic.
10394,US Airways,14-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Very inconvenient. They have a smart phone app that you can do everything on except print a boarding pass. When you arrive at the airport you have to either go to the regular or wait in the self serve kiosk line both of which are very long. We checked in on the app had to wait in line to get a boarding pass so we could check our bags. Bag fees are $25 each. If you want a choice of seats that is $45 per person. If you want expedited boarding that is another $25 per person. Our flight was about 2 1/2 hours long. We were not offered snacks to purchase. We got one tiny cup of water/soda half filled with ice and then another cup of coffee or water for that entire time. Bring water or a beverage and food with you. The seats are very uncomfortable for a person who is short is stature they do not fit the neck properly and you cannot recline far enough to be comfortable.
10395,US Airways,10-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,The pilot claimed to have have miscalculated his fuel needs of Flight US3280 leaving San Antonio to Charlotte and so about 10 minutes outside of Charlotte needed to make an emergency stop at Spartanburg to get fuel. After approximately 30 minutes on the ground we were told we had fuel and would be taking off shortly ten minutes later the pilot announced that he had again miscalculated our fuel need so we needed to wait for another fuel truck to give us even more fuel. After about a total delay of an hour we finally got back in the air and arrived in Charlotte at which time all the passengers who had missed connecting flights were sent to various hotels to await morning flights. I left Charlotte the next morning at 9.30 for Minneapolis my final destination still outraged by the seeming unconcern for the needless danger that this pilot and crew had for the safety and convenience of the passengers.
10396,US Airways,10-Oct-13,USA,6,Economy,3,YES,A friend and I recently traveled from Louisville to Philadelphia to Barcelona. The initial flight (9/26/13) was fine. On the return trip from Barcelona to Louisville (10/6/13) the situation was very difficult. We were late leaving Barcelona so there was necessarily a rush through Customs and Security. We already had our boarding passes confirmed from the day before. When we arrived on time at the Philadelphia gate to go on to Charlotte our seats had been given away. What raises questions for us is that when we deplaned in Philadelphia an agent handed us a possible change of flights. Was that because our seats were already given away or because we had to go through Customs etc. and it was unlikely that we would make it?
10397,US Airways,8-Oct-13,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,Philadelphia to Tel Aviv in economy on A 330-200. This is the 3rd time I used US Air's direct flight for my home town Philadelphia to Tel Aviv The plane was new and the seats had adequate leg room. I prefer the 2x4x2 seating configuration on the A 330 over the 2x5x2 or 3x3x3 configuration of the B777. The on demand entertainment system had a good list of programing. The food was not very good but that is to be expected and they ran out of one of the breakfast options on the return flight. The best part of the flight though were the flight attendants. They were very friendly and professional.
10398,US Airways,8-Oct-13,USA,1,Premium,2,NO,Flight from CLT to Dublin on a 20 year plus 757-200 in economy. Just like sitting on a bus and the service was poor. On return trip upgraded to Envoy class and other then larger seats the service and food offerings were not one would expect for the additional cost. Maybe the CEO of this airline needs to take some anonymous trips so he can experience the poor customer service this airline provides. No doubt the CLT to DUB is a money maker for them as the service is poor the aircraft old the seats uncomfortable and the flight attendants non accommodating.
10399,US Airways,8-Oct-13,New Zealand,5,Economy,3,NO,JFK-CLT-RDU return in early October 2013. US Air isn't officially a budget carrier but the vibe certainly was budget. Basic amenities no IFE limited cash menu. Service was OK but not very efficient.
10400,US Airways,8-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My husband and I were on US Air flight from Phoenix to Boston. The agent at the gate closed the door 7 minutes before the official departure time. We were already at the gate as he was closing it and he refused to let us on. The reason we were delayed were long lines at check-in the computer system not being able to find our legitimate reservation another long line to speak with a live agent followed by a long line at security. The worst element of this experience was the smugness of the agent when he refused to let us on the plane. I'm a frequent business traveler I fly every week (and have been doing it for the past 10 years).
10401,US Airways,4-Oct-13,UK,6,Economy,3,NO,My husband and I have just returned from a trip to the States flying from Manchester UK to San Francisco via Philadelphia then back from Seattle to Manchester. We arrived on time with baggage as one expects but the cabin service experience was poor particularly on the return transatlantic leg. The A330 has an outdated interior and insufficient lavatories. The seat back entertainment was difficult to use and the meals very small. The banana muffin and nothing else for breakfast was a joke. The crew were embarrassed to serve it. Only water juice and tea were available and no coffee. We have travelled to the Far East several times in recent years and the service provided by Emirates and especially Singapore Airlines was far superior.
10402,US Airways,4-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"I stopped flying this airline years ago for all the reasons cited in this forum. However I was convinced by my travel agent to reconsider and booked a round trip flight from PHL to DUB. Delays and mechanical issues are par for the course with this airline and they didn't ""disappoint."" Take off from PHL was delayed three hours. But what has convinced me to never fly with them again is the treatment by the flight crew during both the delay and the flight. I have never experienced a more miserable and inattentive crew in all of my years of flying. What justification does this company have for treating customers in this way? What an awful experience. I will not fly with them again ever."
10403,US Airways,4-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,My husband and I went to Aruba for our honeymoon a few weeks ago. We will never fly with them again! The middle of July comes around and we receive a phone call from US Airways saying they cancelled the flight we booked so we needed to choose a different flight. The only two options available were to either leave and come back the same dates but the travel time was 2 days worth each way or to leave a day early and get a hotel to be able to make it on the next flight leaving the following morning. The second option was our only reasonable choice out of the two. By leaving a day early this meant that my husband and I were going to have to miss an additional day's worth of work. We asked the agent if we could be compensated with a free hotel stay or for our bags and her answer was no. When we get to the baggage check in counter they tell us that we still need to pay for our bags. We stood there arguing with them that we already paid for our bags online. 30 minutes later this was finally straightened out. On our way back from Aruba we ran into the same issue with baggage fees (which we ended up having to pay for twice). We fly into Philadelphia to find out that our flight to Chicago has been delayed 5 hours which puts us getting into Chicago at around 2.00 am. We still had a flight to get on out of Chicago at 8.00 am. They apologize and said it was a staffing issue and that there were no other flights leaving the airport except that one. This was our first and last time with this airline!
10404,US Airways,25-Sep-13,Ireland,0,Economy,1,NO,I was flying from NYC to Dublin Ireland today with a stopover in Philadelphia. There were no problems with my flight from NYC to Philly however that's where the luck ran out. There was an issue with downsizing the aircraft at Philly and so numerous passengers were left stranded I had been told I may have to wait for another flight tomorrow - which thankfully was not the case in the end. Having finally made it onto the flight and taking off an hour later than expected it didn't take much time to realise it was going to be a long journey home. The aircraft itself was tiny two lanes of 3 seats each which I have never encountered on an international flight before. It was cramped the food was awful and the attendants were difficult to deal with disgruntled and overall not welcoming in the slightest. I'm afraid US Airways won't be getting business from me again.
10405,US Airways,25-Sep-13,New Zealand,3,Economy,2,NO,Traveled from Honolulu-Phoenix and Phoenix-New York (JFK) which were both 5 plus hour flights. Economy seating on the first flight was cramped and uncomfortable and inflight crew were unfriendly. Felt more like an overnight bus service. Service on second flight was significantly better but aircraft didn't have any inflight entertainment - not even drop down screens. Chose US Airways due to the cost advantage but next time will spend extra in order to have a much better inflight experience and feel better at my final destination.
10406,US Airways,20-Sep-13,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,Flight was on time. Flew first class which was a mistake. Other than a little more leg room no real discernible difference than coach. Food was bad service was nowhere close to first class or business class. They had two meal selections but when they got to me there was only one. Mind you there were only 12 people in first class. There is absolutely no inflight entertainment. Very odd for a modern carrier. Flight attendant told me they got rid of inflight players because of the cost and weight. Seriously if that is why they got rid of it then they are apparently the only ones. If they are cutting costs that much I'd rather fly another airline who cares about the passenger experience. If flying coach probably ok if you get a really good deal. If business or first class definitely not worth it.
10407,US Airways,16-Sep-13,Switzerland,2,Economy,3,NO,Flew Philadelphia - Zurich in economy. Plane was a 767 exactly 26 years old. Quite run-down inside no in-flight entertainment. I sat in a 'window seat' yet there was no window. Apparently this is a quirk several of the front rows in the old 767s. Food was poor and very little. Guests are offered only a single glass of wine at no charge and this comes out of a paper bottle. Breakfast consisted of a nothing but a small banana muffin. Cabin crew never came around with water or snacks in between meals. In-flight entertainment was non existent. No magazines offered except for the US Airways magazine. Their airport Club lounges are little better than their actual flights. No food offered beyond chips and a few olives. Alcohol is strictly limited. I will try to avoid this airline at all costs particularly as the 767s are scheduled to be in service for another 4 years. Few airlines in the world (apart from the African ones) fly such old aircraft.
10408,US Airways,13-Sep-13,UK,7,Economy,5,YES,Flew Manchester to San Francisco via PHL. Plenty of leg room seats comfortable food average (but I've had a lot worse). Slight delay at PHL due to thunderstorms. Very disappointed that PHL to SFO (5.5 hours) wasn't deemed worthy of inflight entertainment. This leg of the journey was made worse by the ridiculous attitude of so many UIS fliers who take so much baggage on the plane and then moan because there is no where to store it all. Never met so many rude and selfish people in a long time. Return leg was better lovely crews on both legs less whinging penny pinching US flyers made it a nicer experience. Would use again.
10409,US Airways,12-Sep-13,USA,2,First Class,0,NO,Flying between Gulfport MS to New York City. Twice we were delayed due to maintenance. Flight attendants were not pleasant - they were absolutely rude to some foreign passengers. We were first class but had the worst service ever encountered on any airline! Now we are sitting in Charlotte with another delay due to maintenance. I have yet to hear anyone apologize or even care. I will not fly this airline if I can avoid it!
10410,US Airways,5-Sep-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Booked to leave FLL to BOS for travel assignment with a connection in Charlotte. At the gate I was told I would need to check my bag because the flight was very full. After boarding it was discovered that there was a malfunction. Whilst waiting we were told there was another malfunction and there would be a 90 minute delay. We were let off the plane and then re-boarded. Put on another flight this time connecting through PHL. Another delay but we did get to PHL and left FLL prior to the reported time of departure. Got to PHL to find out that there was another delay a gate change and the flight we were set to take was no longer even on the departure board. Told to check the monitors for flight changes. Ended up sitting in PHL for another 90 minutes and the gate was filthy. Upon getting to PHL at approximately 1.45am we were told that our bags never left PHL. It is now 2.58 and our bags just arrived. I have traveled extensively domestically and this is by far the worst airline I have flown.
10411,US Airways,5-Sep-13,Netherlands,3,Economy,2,NO,We flew from Amsterdam to Los Angeles with a switch of planes in Philadelphia on 23/8-/2013. Flying back on 6/9/2013 and I must say we are not looking forward to our flight back. We are used to Delta and United and thought lets try US Airways this time around. The flight is quite long 8 hours and 4.45 hours. The seats were ok we had enough room as long as the person in front of us did not change his seat setting to lay down. The main thing is the plane we were in flew from Amsterdam to Philly with no personal entertainment it had overhead screens with poor quality video which you could hardly see from the window seat. I think for such long flights personal entertainment is a must have we were really disappointed and did not expect this especially not since we were used to all of that with Delta and United. So we arrived in Philly and the transfer to the new plane went well. We got on our new plane an A321 from Philly to LA. Flight time 4.45 minutes. Guess what no personal entertainment onboard not even an overhead screen. The crew were nice the food moderate but I will never fly with them again.
10412,US Airways,2-Sep-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Manchester to Philadelphia and return August 2013. I can only assume that the negative comments on this forum come from a very small minority who have had a bad experience with US Airways or serial complainers as I can offer nothing but praise for my own family's recent flights with this airline. Our main consideration was how the seats would be for nearly eight hours and I have to say that they were very comfortable with a substantial amount of leg-room. The food on the way out was excellent not quite so good on the way back but still OK. The personal entertainment on offer was very impressive and the cabin staff polite and friendly. Flights were on time both ways. From my own experience I would certainly recommend this airline for transatlantic flights.
10413,US Airways,2-Sep-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew Dublin - Philadelphia Philadelphia to Orlando May 2013. If you are able to spend a little bit more to fly with a different airline do it. Party of 7 including 3 kids. Staff boarder line rude on DUB to PHL PHL to DUB flights. Delays PHL to Orlando Orlando - PHL. Reduced size of plane PHL to DUB and told customers tough luck if you were in the row that no longer existed total shambles at boarding. Apparently had still been selling the flight at PHL even though massively over booked. In flight entertainment from the ninety's. Will never use them again. We were flying budget but still can't believe the poor level of service for a budget airline.
10414,US Airways,20-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,It seems like some things never change since I ended up spending the night in the Philly airport last night. Came in from Punta Cana on a US Airways flight which was delayed getting to Punta Cana. Our flight ended up leaving over an hour late from Punta Cana even though we were told it would only be a half hour delayed. Once arrived in Philly we ran to the gate from security and ended up missing the flight to Tampa. The plane was still at the gate but we were told it was too late. We went to customer service where they did nothing but give me a boarding pass for a flight at 8am the next morning. They claimed it wasn't the airlines fault we missed our connection since our original US Airways flight was delayed. Had to sleep in the Philly airport. US Airways you disappointed me yet again.
10415,US Airways,20-Aug-13,Singapore,7,First Class,4,YES,Out of the big US carriers this one is my favourite. Will miss it as it becomes American and thus a One World partner. The plane on the Atlanta - Hartford (via Charlotte) route was a relatively new A320. I find their first class to have the most legroom out of all the US carriers. The meal was decent and the service at least pleasant. Their wifi system also worked very well.
10416,US Airways,19-Aug-13,Canada,2,First Class,2,NO,My girlfriend and I flew from YHZ-PHL-BDA in First Class last month. All flight attendants were friendly and provided the best service with the limited product that they could. All flights were on time and there were no baggage issues. No meal on any flight and zero in flight entertainment on any flight. Drinks were served in plastic cups in First Class. The seats were fine but US Airways needs to be put out of their misery. I hope that the merger with American goes ahead and the service on the merged airline is stepped up because right now the domestic/ North American product on US Airways is two-star not three. It is a pastime in Canada to complain about the service on Air Canada. I would encourage everyone who complains about Air Canada to fly with US Airways they will realize how lucky we are to have Air Canada.
10417,US Airways,15-Aug-13,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,"We flew Boston-Philly-Zurich and back. All flights were on time. All personnel both in the airports an on the flights were competent and pleasant. The food considering it was ""airplane food"" was decent. The seats were a little cramped but typical for economy class. In general we had a very positive experience."
10418,US Airways,15-Aug-13,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,1788 CLT to ORD. This is definitely the worst airline. Every flight is delayed. Never taken off on time in the last 3 years. Add to that the rude staff at the counter who usually don't have any information. They keep blaming everything on 'inbound aircraft.' And this is at the hub Charlotte where they have plenty of aircraft's to redeploy.
10419,US Airways,14-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,London Heathrow travel outbound through Charlotte NC return through Philadelphia. Both ways a fairly new Airbus A330-300 with great entertainment system and average seating for transatlantic economy class. Our issues with US Airways is not with their international service it is with their horrific domestic service and the worst customer service experience imaginable. We live less than 2 hours from the Philadelphia airport and spent twice as much time as we did on the plane from London Heathrow to our home. They're cancelled all flights to our local airport and after 13 hours in an airport less than 2 hours from our home we had to rent a car (at our own expense) to drive home because US Airways cannot complete a transaction. This has happened now 3 times. Avoid Philadelphia completely and be warned that US Airways customer service will treat you horribly.
10420,US Airways,14-Aug-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,The plane was old all toilets except one in first class stopped working 2 hours before we landed on a transatlantic flight from Philadelphia to Athens Greece. The food was not edible the flight attendants were rude! The entertainment system was ancient and the movie stopped 3/4 of the way and could not continue. My nephew traveled a few days earlier and had similar complaints. My worst transatlantic flight in the 50+ years I've been going back and forth!
10421,US Airways,13-Aug-13,Switzerland,9,Economy,3,YES,GVA-FRA-CLT-BOS on 1 August. I am tall 196 cm. Surprisingly the flight FRA CLT was comfortable the seat pitch was ok I didn't put my legs on the aisle. Flight on time. The second flight was delayed 1 hour due to weather conditions which was totally understandable. Return was SFO-PHL-ZRH here I was lucky to have on the both flights the bulkhead seats which have a lot of space. The food was average but this is not an important factor for me. Generally I had a very good experience with US Airways!
10422,US Airways,12-Aug-13,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,SEA-CLT-HHH return. Not a single flight was on time. Crews were indifferent at best and otherwise berating their employer to passengers. Their primary interest was in getting credit card applications. Seats were extremely tight in first noticeably less pitch than narrowbody flights on United or American. No entertainment no power outlets. The food was tragic on the outbound edible on the return but served without linens and with a paper napkin. No milk for coffee on domestic flights. Although I had a revenue first class ticket for $1700 US Airways still wanted me to pay extra for better seats on each flight(!) The Charlotte hub was a mess signs were broken moving sidewalks inoperable and my gates changed on the spur of the moment in each direction. Bags took close to 45 minutes to be unloaded in Seattle about 20 minutes in Hilton Head.
10423,US Airways,12-Aug-13,Denmark,0,Economy,1,NO,We had flown with SAS to Amsterdam and US Airways should take us to Philadelphia and then Seattle. On our returning trip back we started at LA with stops in Philadelphia and Frankfurt. On our trip to Seattle our flight from Philadelphia to Seattle was cancelled due to mechanical issues so we had to wait a couple of hours and take a connecting flight through San Francisco. My baggage had somehow been lost in Philadelphia - so did not receive it until the day after I arrived. The same thing happened on my way back I was obligated to hand over my hand baggage when boarding. I have flown many different companies through the years but this is the worst experience. The inflight service was okay - but bagage handling was apparently non existent.
10424,US Airways,9-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,Been in Charlotte NC for 8 hours of delays been put on different flights only to be turned away with plane still sitting there by there rude gate employees with no manners and no customer service.
10425,US Airways,6-Aug-13,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"US Airways itself was not too bad. The problem was the smaller airlines they contract to. Boston to DC (Reagan) - not too bad was on time at least. DC to Chicago - delayed but no idea why. Sat in Chicago for 2 hours boarded deplaned boarded again - they ""couldn't find the pilot"". Finally got to Des Moines. Two days later Des Moines to Charlotte - delayed no idea why. While waiting for my carry-on to be retrieved from ""valet checking"" so I could make my connection to Philadelphia the gate attendant was quite rude when I asked the status of my connection. Ran through the airport to make the connection then sat on the plane for 30 minutes. Was also told that I would need to check my carry-on because there was ""no room"" in the overhead compartment. When I boarded most of the overhead compartments were open - several were empty most were less than half full. Had to collect bag from baggage claim when I got to Philadelphia but at least I didn't have to pay for it. Philadelphia to Boston was slightly delayed because of a check engine light that came on after we were all boarded. They did manage to get maintenance in fairly quickly and apparently got the problem resolved - but this was US Air not a smaller airline. I'm going back to Southwest and Jet Blue - cheaper more reliable more customer oriented and they keep better track of their pilots."
10426,US Airways,2-Aug-13,UK,4,Economy,3,NO,FRA-PHL-SFO. Total mess - 2 of 4 FRA-originating flights delayed due to weather apparently. My FRA-PHL flight delayed 2 hours missing the PHL-SFO connection. About 100 people in line to the ticket desk in FRA because the FRA-CLT flight was delayed 7 hours. Called US Airways and was rebooked within 5 minutes. Excellent customer service. US Airways flights depart from by far the worst part of FRA airport (and one of the worst areas of any airport anywhere). No food no shops nothing - gate was changed unannounced then everyone was asked to leave the gate area to be re-checked. As I said complete mess by both airport and airline staff. In the end flight arrived PHL 2 hours late as expected. PHL-SFO flight also delayed without reason or apology by 2 hours meaning arrival to SFO at a cringeworthy 1.30am. Bag thankfully redirected and I have to admit service by flight attendants great throughout and good iFE on the FRA-PHL flight.
10427,US Airways,2-Aug-13,USA,5,Economy,3,YES,Flew PHL-CDG and CDG-CLT in Economy. US Air was the low cost carrier for this route and it showed. Food was fundamentally inedible but I was grateful to have brought my own. Crews were mostly friendly and helpful. Flight seemed to be a non-stop sales pitch to buy duty free upgraded snacks etc. I thought several times that this unnecessarily disturbed what could have been a serene flight. Had the new Airbus planes both ways. Someone had broken off the tip of their headphones in the receptacle and the poor FA could not remove it even after returning with tweezers. Thus I could not use the AVOD for the entire eight hour flight. US Air got me there mostly on time but this was not a very enjoyable or peaceful experience.
10428,US Airways,2-Aug-13,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,Have mixed feelings about the airline. I think they have decent flight service. I took the Dublin - PHL route and was surprised by the cheerful service aboard. Food was good and there was free wine (United needs to learn about this). My domestic connection got delayed and the personnel were not very helpful with the situation (I tried to get in an earlier flight and they did not help with it). I ended up flying that segment with Jet Blue and complain later. The customer service representative received the feedback and took actions about it. I would still recommend them particularly for international flights.
10429,US Airways,2-Aug-13,USA,7,Business,4,YES,CLT-FRA-CLT. I love flying US Airways direct (hate PHL). Good service - the newer A330's are a great improvement. Good service and value.
10430,US Airways,1-Aug-13,USA,3,First Class,2,NO,Kona-ABQ via Phoenix in first class. US Airways first class is worse than some coach seats I have been in. The seat in front of me was rubbing against my legs (I would expect this in coach but in first?). One drink run before take off and not another one for 4 hours. The meal was edible but very small and disappointing. On the second flight the crew was nicer but than again they are not US airways because the flight was operated by skywest. I had a 3 hour layover in Phoenix and even though I had paid for first class I was only allowed into the lounge if I gave them more money.
10431,US Airways,31-Jul-13,UK,8,Economy,3,YES,"SFO-PHL-FRA trying US Airways for the first time after being rebooked ""from"" them onto other airlines due to delays. Surprised with how decent they are. Both flights had roomy (though not very comfortable) seats excellent service on-board and arrived on time/early. Acceptable food on the PHL-FRA and even free wine - not that it's any good. IFE system is excellent on the A330s. Would fly again."
10432,US Airways,25-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Very frustrating experience with US Air when flying to Glasgow last week. Our traveling parties were meeting in PHL to connect to the same transatlantic flight. Both flights delayed due to weather but they go in to PHL at around the same time. Our flight then sat out on the tarmac for 1.5 hrs because they didn't have a gate for us. While we were stuck out there the captain kept saying all flights out were grounded so we would make our connections but that wasn't true as mine left leaving me stranded. Next flight waited for passengers to come in from a delayed flight. Why couldn't they do that for me? I finally made it to Glasgow the next day via London but missed the first day of vacation. On the way back our flight was delayed 2 hours due to maintenance and the next one was as well. On top of all this the staff were rude pushy and the flight attendants were surly the meals were gross and the TV sound did not work throughout so that was 7 hours with nothing to watch. They also kept running out of drinks and food by the time they reached our seats. If I can help it I will never fly US Air again!
10433,US Airways,25-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Left LAX on Saturday to take my daughter to Providence. Flight delayed and we missed out connecting flight to providence was stranded in Philadelphia. They did not offer any help and just gave us new tickets to come back to airport next day. Sunday morning went to airport realizing that they had booked my 16 daughter on a different flight to DC! Ended up renting a car and driving. Went back to airport on Monday 7/22 to catch my flight to LAX. Flight from Providence was late again and I missed my connection again. Was re-routed to Phoenix and stayed on the plane for 3 hours for bad weather and missed the connection from Phoenix to LA. Stranded in Phoenix again and finally made it to Orange county airport on Tuesday.
10434,US Airways,22-Jul-13,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"Choice Seats aren't choice at all. We flew a 6pm to midnight flight from Philadelphia to Glasgow on 17 July 2013. We paid $99.00 each for ""Choice"" seats 24A and 24B. These were considered choice seats by the airline because they are Emergency Exit seats with the extra leg room. Unfortunately they are directly behind the lavatories. The cabin lights were dimmed we took out our blankets and pillows closed our eyes and someone opened the lavatory door flooding our seating area with glaring florescent light. Our plans for catching a nap were ruined."
10435,US Airways,22-Jul-13,UK,8,Economy,4,YES,"Flew London to Philadelphia then on to Greensboro NC and return. Outbound the first leg was excellent. The connecting flight to PTI was delayed as there was no fuel in the aircraft then an engine failed on start up. The Captain kept us informed as the engineers tried to fix it and an hour later we boarded a replacement airframe. On the return there was an hour delay at Philadelphia due to the aircraft being ""too hot in the cabin"" as it had been sat in the sun all day but the staff kept us informed of progress. What I did appreciate was that the bags went straight through and were ready to collect straight away. There is always room for improvement but I think these guys should focus a bit more on the maintenance - get the aircraft ready earlier and make sure it is serviceable before the flight - not wait until everyone is at the gate waiting to board."
10436,US Airways,20-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,DFW to Phoenix 6/30/13. Then from Phoenix to San Diego because of fog problems the plane could not land so they re-routed us to Phoenix. During this time I had a connection flight leaving San Diego and my husband and I missed our connection flight leaving San Diego to Hawaii. I went to the Phoenix counter to just get a brush off and were told that another flight was leaving San Diego to Hawaii that day. By the time we arrived in San Diego that morning we had been left stranded. I will never take a flight to San Diego nor will I fly US Airways. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. I had to purchase a whole new ticket that night to get us to our destination.
10437,US Airways,18-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Every time I book a flight I promise myself that I will not use US Airways again. Unfortunately they are the only airline that fly into Hilton Head Island so we are captive to them. Once again they have cancelled our flight from the island into Charlotte and we will not make our flight to Phoenix. The explanation given was ""weather"" in Charlotte. Doppler radar says 30% chance of rain in Charlotte during the time we would have been there. The only thing I hate worse than a cancelled flight is a blatant lie about the reason the flight was cancelled. No compensation given at all. Can't get out until tomorrow."
10438,US Airways,18-Jul-13,UK,0,Economy,1,NO,Dublin to Charlotte (5th July 13) Charlotte to Dublin (12th July 13). Disappointment at both flights but especially Dublin to Charlotte: 1) ran out of earphones so no entertainment for 8 hours. 2) one of the toilets out of order for full flight. 3) another toilet ran out of toilet paper. 4) hot breakfast ice cold. Return flight - my wife asked if we could upgrade but were told flight full. Expected to depart at 6.20pm but did not board until approx 7pm despite on-time advised. Made to sit on plane while we waited for passengers from another flight who had missed their flight to Paris - eventual departure 8pm. Some of these were put in first class although we had been told flight full with no upgrades!
10439,US Airways,15-Jul-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Have always traveled using U.S. Airways usually from Charlotte NC to NYC. Last year entrusted them with our 16 year old traveling alone to Paris for a month. This year we traveled as a family to Paris and will be using them again in August as they now have a direct flight from Charlotte NC to Dublin Ireland. Have never had any trouble with this airline. Luckily no bad weather so flights have always been on time. My only complaint is on domestic flights they let people with huge carry-on luggage board and they fill up the available overhead spaced. I have had to check my regulation size carry on bag on a couple of occasions for lack of room. They don't seem to care what size your carry on bag is. Also food is awful but this is probably true of most airlines. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.
10440,US Airways,11-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Two days trying to get from LGA to MEM through DC. Flight from DC to Memphis was delayed 2 hrs then they put us on the plane and after 2 hrs seated they cancelled the fight. Trying to get back to NY after 2 hours inside the plane they cancel again. They put me on another flight to NY which finally left after another additional 2 hrs delay. Next day: try to get to Memphis again LGA-CLT ok but the second flight CLT-MEM was 2 hrs delayed again. Staff unhelpful and rude. Will never use their service again.
10441,US Airways,8-Jul-13,India,8,Economy,3,YES,PHL-SDF and SDF-PHL. Flights were on time on both occasions. Comfortable flight and we had a pleasant crew member both ways. US Airways operates small aircraft on this sector so the interiors were cramped but overall good experience considering that this was one of the few direct flights between PHL and SDF and the flight duration's were just over an hour and half each.
10442,US Airways,5-Jul-13,Germany,4,Economy,3,NO,EWR-PHL-FRA: Ground staff on EWR were friendly and made efforts to put me on an earlier flight as the original flight to PHL was delayed. PHL-FRA was a brand new Airbus 330 in fact only 4 weeks old so the aircraft itself was in order except the staff. Apart from one crew member all others were rude and any request from passengers seemed like bother. Apart from surly crew drinks were available for free except alcohol and food was just awful. On positive note the AVOD has good selection and soft drinks available in gallery. I would avoid US Airways because of the attitude of crew and bad food.
10443,US Airways,5-Jul-13,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,Flight from Charlottesville VA to Chicago cancelled due to mechanical issues. Put on a flight the next day and given the worst seats on the plane even though there were seats available for a $25 up charge. Given the run- around. Talked to 5 different people and everyone said someone else should be able to do it. Never again.
10444,US Airways,4-Jul-13,Germany,5,Economy,3,NO,FRA-EWR: Outbound flight was old Boeing 737 instead of Airbus A330. Ground staff at FRA are friendly. Once boarded the flight was delayed 35 mins and information given by captain. It was all aged male crew. The crew were polite and friendly enough to cater most of the needs. The big change I experienced that drinks were unlimited compared to past where you had to buy drinks. Crew made about 3 to 4 rounds for drinks and later only seen during breakfast round. Being an old aircraft there were no personal TV but they played three different movies on those ceiling attached TV's. They also loaded my requested meal which was compared to none but trash. All in all experience could have been much better if they provide Airbus aircraft.
10445,US Airways,3-Jul-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"Flight from Charlotte to Rome June 20. Rude crew no manners 6 staff frowned and looked like we were bothering them by simply being there. No hello no you're welcome just gruff minimal words. Not one crew member said 'thank you for flying with us"" etc as we disembarked. Just stood there watching all the passengers leave the plane. Return trip was July 1 2013 - service was just as bad. We went through Philly and had same negative and rude treatment on the ground. They cancelled our Philly - Hartford flight. We had to wait over 5 hours for our connection. One person only on the entire Rome - Philadelphia flight said thank you and was pleasant. On a positive note the crew from Philadelphia to Hartford were very nice."
10446,US Airways,2-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Will never fly with US Airways again. Everyone boarded and was kept on flight for an hour due to maintenance problems. Temperature in Phoenix while stuck on the flight was over 100 degrees. We were kept waiting on the flight for an hour. Water was brought around but it was poured into cups. We were not given full bottles. Turns out there was an issue with a window. Flight was delayed an hour then a couple more hours. Currently flight is pushed back to 6 pm with an original 10.45am departure time.
10447,US Airways,2-Jul-13,USA,0,First Class,0,NO,Wilmington NC to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Burlington Vermont. First flight delayed for 'maintenance' a couple of hours then finally canceled. Then booked on evening flight at 7.40pm. That flight canceled due to weather. Finally I took a flight the next morning at 6.40 arrived to my destination a day late. My return trip scheduled for 5.40 pm but there was a delay. Counter personnel could not give straight answers or decent advise. No other flights had to pay out for a hotel room that's not covered due to weather cancellation. Got an email confirmation on a 6.50am flight the next day I showed up to the counter and they did not have me on that flight. Now I'm booked on a 7.50 flight to Washington DC and a 1.50 flight home. I will make US Airways my last choice.
10448,US Airways,2-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,6/16/13. Flew from San Francisco CA to Cancun MX via Phoenix. You have to check in your self they don't have a counter person to help you with check in at least not at San Francisco. I was traveling with my family total of 7 3 adults and 4 Kids it was not easy at all. US airways employee's were rude and not very helpful. If you want a snack you need to pay for it all they offered on a 5 hours flight was coffee and water. Will never use this airline again.
10449,US Airways,1-Jul-13,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,LAX to Rome via Philly. The trip there went smoothly but there was weather coming home which delayed our flight. However we had a 3 hour lay over in Philly and arrived with 2 hours to make the connecting flight. When we presented our boarding passes we were told that our seats were cancelled as they didn't think we would make the flight. I was traveling with my elderly mother so I insisted that they get us on that flight. In the end they found seats for most of us but I had to sit separately from my mother and kids. To add insult to injury some people did not get on the flight although there were still empty seats. They cancelled our seats and put us all through turmoil for nothing. Our gate was also changed with no notice and at one point they had 3 flights waiting in one boarding area. No organization and I have flown with them for the last time.
10450,US Airways,27-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Every flight I had scheduled had a major problem. Flight from Harrisburg to Philadelphia was immediately declared as 1 hour delay. While waiting we were told that we would be on time and they boarded us after several passengers had already been deferred to other flights. We sat on the plane for 25 minutes. Pilot notified that we would be leaving. Pilot then asked all of us to leave the plane again. We left the plane and returned to waiting area. While waiting for information regarding our flight to Philadelphia I was called to redirect my flight from Harrisburg to Charlotte NC to Sacramento. I would be arriving 2 hours later than my original schedule. (Previously 8.45 now 10.45). We finally arrived in Sacramento and when arriving at gate the pilot found another US Airline in our arrival gate. We sat for 20 minutes. We sat for at least 20 minutes waiting for availability of a gate for our plane to arrive. I got home at midnight originally would have arrived by 9.45. I was called to desk and transferred to a flight to Charlotte NC. I was to arrive at my original destination Sacramento over 2 hours later than my original flights.
10451,US Airways,25-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Cleveland to Fort Walton Beach via Charlotte. Both flights delayed. Once we boarded the second flight we sat on the runway for 45 minutes while mechanics changed a tyre. Coming back I flew Pensacola to Cleveland via Charlotte. Actually got in early to Charlotte around 5pm but found out that another US Airways plane took our gate so sat on the runway for 40 minutes. Connecting flight to Cleveland departed at 5.50. Needing to get off the plane I asked the flight attendant how much longer because I was going to miss my flight. She said they have no control over missed flights. Very rude and not accommodating at all! Once I finally got off the plane at 5.40pm I ran though the airport to make my flight to Cleveland. With 20 seconds to spare we made it. But I will never be flying US Airways again!
10452,US Airways,25-Jun-13,USA,0,First Class,1,NO,Flew First Class from PHX to EWR round trip. Outgoing flight weather delayed 3 hrs (not their fault). Food inedible and served cold. Unbelievable for First Class. No entertainment no headphones etc. Not a quiet flight either since the 2 attendants sitting nearby in the jump seats were chattering for the entire flight when not serving. Return flight food slightly edible similar to coach several years ago. Gate agent failed to flag luggage as First Class so it was delivered last. Very bad experience especially coming off a First Class flight on Hawaiian Air which was very pleasant.
10453,US Airways,22-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,St. Louis to Orlando via Charlotte. First flight left late and they made no effort to hold our connecting flight (on the same carrier). Provided no information on gate changes and we missed our meetings. Got up at 3am only to end cooling our heels in Charlotte all day. Will never book with them again.
10454,US Airways,20-Jun-13,USA,1,First Class,2,NO,"London-Charlotte connecting Charlotte-San Francisco. As others have said Envoy service LHR-Charlotte was fine. Bad things happened once we arrived in Charlotte. Plane sat on tarmac for 30 minutes in queue. Then a large storm arrived as plane had not departed on time we were caught in the storm. Sat on tarmac for nearly 2 hours. Pilot told us every 15 minutes that ""Plane returning to gate for hail inspection"". Once parked at gate after 2 hrs pilot told us: ""Leave plane if you want just take boarding pass"". We followed this advice. After 15 minutes in terminal called airline to ask if we could rebook given uncertainty and they said BTW the flight is cancelled. Gate staff would not let us back on plane to collect carry-on's. We re-booked on another flight. We were told it would depart from Gate 15 then Gate 8 then Gate 15 then back to Gate 8. Flight finally left 2 hours late. None of our bags arrived even though airline had 2 hours to transfer to new flight and we were assured this would occur. Waited in long line at 1am to file lost baggage report. Our last flight with this airline. Food on domestic legs inedible no inflight entertainment."
10455,US Airways,20-Jun-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,It started badly when we arrived at the airport to discover that US Airways had separated my husband and me from each other - for an international flight. The ticket agent was rude and inflexible. It culminated on the return trip where we were again separated. The TV/video system does not respond to touch and in order to make something happen you practically have to pound on the screen - obviously affecting the person sitting in the seat in front of you. The restrooms were filthy. Our flight was canceled from PHL to IND because of weather and the agents rescheduling us were rude. We were re-scheduled for a flight 12 hours later which turned out to be the best scenario for our group (43 of us). Most of us had luggage that did not make it until the next day. I truly do not know how US Airways continues to operate with customer service being so poor.
10456,US Airways,20-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,If you are disabled don't fly US Airways. I made the mistake of booking a non direct flight instead of a non-stop flight. Flight delayed over an hour in Philadelphia. I sat on the plane for an hour unable to leave to get some food as the transporter had already left. The flight attendant did offer me some water apple juice chips and salsa free of charge. Flight left Boston at 11.30 and did not leave Philadelphia until 3 or later. When we finally arrived in Atlanta after 5.&#8221; Unfortunately the wheelchair service was terrible. Very disappointed!
10457,US Airways,20-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew in from Frankfurt connecting in Philadelphia had a first class ticket with my husband went to the lounge problems getting in then waited 4 plus hours for flight to San Diego. Went to the gate and there seemed to be a problem they announced that they were having personnel issues waiting for a crew member to arrive - this was at 8pm (flight to leave at 8.25pm). Flight then cancelled and we were told to get a hotel and rescheduled the flight next day at 6pm no first class and had to pay $250 out of pocket to stay overnight. Next flight awful flight attendants rude sour. Will never fly US air again!
10458,US Airways,14-Jun-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Kansas City to Seattle with a stop in Phoenix. On the day of my flight I got ready went to the airport and was helped by a lovely woman at the check in counter had no problems checking in my 2 bags and then went to wait for the plane. It was on time and ready to go had no issues with my carry on luggage and had a pleasant flight to Phoenix the staff member doing the intercom system was even showing us interesting things that were outside the window. Plane in Phoenix was on time as well the staff onboard were courteous and fun. My bags arrived to Seattle.
10459,US Airways,14-Jun-13,USA,7,Economy,5,YES,Flight ZRH-PHL on a 767. As noted in other comments those planes are very old with no individual in-flight entertainment modules in Economy class. The overhead monitors are just a few so unless you are seated close to them you need to have very good eyes to see what's going on selection of movies was pathetic. I am 6'3' but the seats were actually rather comfortable and roomy albeit worn out. Only complimentary alcohol is wine (from a carton?). Crew was polite although certain members did have a bit of an attitude. Overall US Airways will get you to your destination (often cheaply) which is what matters for most passengers.
10460,US Airways,12-Jun-13,Ireland,0,Economy,1,NO,I've just come back from a 2 week trip to the US from Ireland. I bought return flights to Boston with a connection through Philadelphia. On arrival in Philadelphia (which is a hub for US Airways seemingly) our connection was cancelled with no notice to passengers waiting at the gate. 20 mins after the flight was due to go the sign above the gate was still saying 'On Time'. We were told initially that all other flights were booked out that evening except for another 6 hours later which had no guarantee's of leaving. Eventually exhausted we agreed to layover for the night in a nearby hotel on US Airways expense. We flew the next days 18 hrs late. On our return flight via Philadelphia we were delayed on the runway 2 hours in Boston and arrived in Philadelphia 5 mins before our connection was to leave. They never held back the flight even though a substantial number of flights from Boston that evening had a large number of people travelling on that flight. Again we had to layover for the night. It was 24 hrs later before we flew out. Amongst all of this mayhem we came across the most rudest uncaring and incompetent Customer representatives I've come across. I will never fly with this airline again.
10461,US Airways,12-Jun-13,USA,4,Economy,0,NO,Quebec City to Philadelphia. The plane was late so several customers had to be rescheduled. It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to check in 17 customers. The ticket agents were steadily working but it seemed the system for that airport was either antiquated or they had difficulty receiving/sending current information. Not sure if the fault was with poorly trained agents or a lousy system but the wait time was inexcusable. Then once we (finally) got on the plane we were delayed another 20 minutes while the baggage handlers arranged and rearranged the luggage in the storage area below the cabin. That extra 20 minutes caused us to miss our connecting flight. Not a good experience.
10462,US Airways,11-Jun-13,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,Flight from Boston to Charlotte delayed for weather a lot of passengers had a tight connection time. The staff made no effort for suggesting passengers who need connection to deboard first in order to catch the next flight. Had to spend a whole night waiting for the flight the next morning.
10463,US Airways,10-Jun-13,USA,0,Business,3,NO,Sky Harbor Phoenix to DFW this past Thursday. Flight crew were rude to passengers. We board the plane and taxi to the runway. After 20 minutes the pilot announces that due to electrical malfunctions we would be returning to the gate to allow maintenance onboard. This seemed understandable. Once we returned to the gate they opened the plane doors. After 15 minutes both pilots exited the plane. I took this opportunity to grab my cell phone to send a text message to my husband who would be picking me up. A flight attendant immediately turned and yelled at me and said that I was not allowed to have my cell phone on. I am a frequent business traveler and even have a flight scheduled for week after next. I am cancelling the flight perfectly willing to pay a cancellation fee and I will never fly this airline again.
10464,US Airways,7-Jun-13,USA,5,Economy,0,NO,Flew from JFK-CLT-LGA. First flight was good overall except baggage was very slow to be returned. Return flight flight attendants seemed a bit clueless and my tray table was broken (it was an older aircraft but still.) Not a bad airline but not my first choice in any scenario.
10465,US Airways,7-Jun-13,Ireland,8,Economy,5,YES,The flight from check in to the actual flight experience was good the seats where okay the crew were polite served drinks respond quickly to needs. Boarding was fast from Charlotte to Houston return flight was lovely and the crew were excellent. The inflght entertainment is rubbish so come with your ipad loaded with music or movies. 757-200 are old planes used for the Dublin-Charlotte route apart from that I will use them for the right price.
10466,US Airways,5-Jun-13,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,US Airways called me about 5 minutes before I was going to get to the airport for PHL-SDF flight. Told that my flight was canceled. They offered my wife and I tickets to Indianapolis but no connecting flight to Louisville. The next flight was 21.30 (9 hours after the original to SDF). Flight was 45 minutes late taking off. Gates changed 3 times without notice given to passengers and departure board was not updated.
10467,US Airways,5-Jun-13,UK,9,Business,4,YES,LHR-CLT-SRQ-CLT-LAS. Envoy class LHR-CLT on A330-300 very good. Full flight in both classes. Boarded on time but delayed takeoff due to congestion arrival CLT on time. Seats comfortable with a good view out of the windows in row A on a 1x2x1 configuration. Food very good and unusual for me ate all courses offered. Inflight snack bar available. Staff friendly and helpful. Charlotte airport excellent for USA arrival through immigration customs bags onto SRQ and in the lounge within 40 minutes. A lot better than LAX at 3 hours plus. CLT-Sarasota and back on US Express both on time and again good crew. Ground staff also very helpful. CLT-Las Vegas on an A321 again full flight no entertainment but food OK again. Only mentioned the credit cards on this flight but not too pushy. Priority bags delivered first on all flights. Overall a very good experience to counter all the negative ones.
10468,US Airways,4-Jun-13,UK,6,Economy,4,YES,MAN-PHL-LAS on 8th May and SFO-PHL-MAN on 26th May. Transatlantic legs in A330 much better than domestic segments by A320 within the USA. Food onboard in long haul fine served a glass of wine for free if requested which is an improvement. Breakfast tasty if only lacking in quantity. On 5 hour domestic flights only water and 1 non alcoholic drink served plus coffee/snack on outbound. Effectively operates a no frills model domestically even if you travel on a transatlantic ticket. They should issue free vouchers at least for people travelling long haul although no charge for checked bags on such ticket. AVOD installed on transatlantic temperamental but did work and headsets now free. Would not pay a premium to fly this carrier but as price paid for an open jaw return significantly lower than more premium carrier options was worth doing. All check in queues quite short made to use self service at SFO but system could not find our reservation and had to see agent anyway. Some staff are good at their jobs others going through the motions particularly on domestic leg. This is an average airline nothing special but if schedules and pricing acceptable would use again.
10469,US Airways,29-May-13,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,US airways cancelled my first flight from Boston to Philadelphia (connecting in Philly to go to Richmond) while I was on my way to the airport. When they gave me my new flight the next day they did not put my brother and I next to each other when our seats were together on the original flight (seats next to each other were available on the flight). When we made it to Philadelphia the next day they cancelled our flight to Richmond and had to schedule again! Customer service were good at putting us on the new flight but flying this airline is a gamble.
10470,US Airways,29-May-13,UK,9,First Class,5,YES,Flew PHL to SJU return. US Airways use a 757 that was originally configured to fly the transatlantic routes on some of these services. The seats were proper old-style business class cradle type with great leg room and plenty of recline. Service excellent. Food good. No in-flight entertainment on either sector. Would definitely choose US Airways on this route if they continue using their 757s with the ex-long haul configuration. Both flights on-time.
10471,US Airways,29-May-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,I had a miserable experience and customer service has been worthless. Our flight was delayed for over 4 hours due to auxiliary power failure. After 4 hours they took off even though nothing was fixed. Dealing with customer service is pointless - they don't know anything and just give you canned response. I will never fly them again.
10472,US Airways,29-May-13,UK,9,Business,5,YES,LHR-PHL and PHL-LHR. Absolutely no complaints. On-time. Excellent seat in envoy class. Friendly service and good food. Wines not as good as BA and no Champagne pre-take off or in-flight only sparkling Italian Prosecco. Lounge in PHL inferior to BA's but US Airways use the Star Alliance lounge at LHR which is good. Would use again if the price was right.
10473,US Airways,27-May-13,USA,10,First Class,5,YES,2nd international flight with US Airways in F Cl (Envoy) 1st was PHL-TLV-PHL and 2nd was PHL-FRA-PHL. Found the service excellent. On time-comfortable and an extremely accommodating staff. Very pleased - will definitely fly them again. Inflight services excellent.
10474,US Airways,24-May-13,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,DEN-PHL-FCO and return. Not sure how they managed this but all flights departed late but arrived on time so no complaints there. Flew economy seats were comfortable enough although the rows are close together. cabin crew on all flights very pleasant; international crew did an especially nice job. International in-flight entertainment in economy is very nice. Would fly again.
10475,US Airways,22-May-13,USA,5,Economy,4,NO,Flight 38 (LAX to CLT) this past week. My sister who was visiting from out of country had her flight delayed because of some issue with the cabin crew and almost missed her connecting flight. Her baggage was delivered on a later flight to our hotel which was the least they could do. Our customer service rep was very professional and helpful in assisting us. US Airways is a great way to fly on a budget but they need to fix issues like this or no amount of value can make it up.
10476,US Airways,22-May-13,USA,6,Economy,4,NO,"Seat 24F Flight 1471. The seats in back are made for people who are less than 5"" tall and 120lbs. They install the seat so that your shoulder is up against the window panel which shoves you into the person next to you. You cant recline the seat and it is installed cockeyed so that your back knows you are tilted forward the whole ride long. I am glad it was only for an hour or so. People in front of me chimed in about sitting on top of one another. Paid for preferred access and watched the TSA line move like lightning while preferred access stood there like idiots paying for a service that is non existent. When you try to upgrade a seat to first class you loose the $ for the first upgrade. Fix that seat so it is flat and not tilting forward."
10477,US Airways,21-May-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,3/4 of my scheduled flights had serious issues. 4th flight I didn't take - my husband and I opted to take a rental car. First flight was taxiing to the runway we went back to the gate and changed flights. Replacement plane was fine. Connecting flight delayed due to a problem with the fuelling truck and then had an aborted take-off. We had to wait over an hour until they put us on a different plane at the opposite end of the airport. On the returning flight from Cancun we were notified mid-air over the Atlantic that there was some kind of electrical issue and that we had to make a cautionary landing in Miami. We were in Miami on a hot plane for 3 hours. Flight attendants did not check on us. They didn't come by with water. We had to go get it from the back where they were filing cups. Finally we left again and were served 2 tiny cookies. We of course missed our connecting flight in Philly. They threw a voucher at us for a hotel 15 miles away. By that point everything in the airport was closed in regards to food and we had nothing to eat all day. We tried calling customer service only to be told repeatedly that they have no phone support for such issues.
10478,US Airways,21-May-13,Canada,0,Economy,2,NO,"Recent experience on YYZ-PHL-CDG-PHL-YYZ was awful. Ignoring luggage issues on both in and outbound flights the ground service and scheduling were terrifying. Confirmed flights were cancelled or rescheduled without notice (email or text messages were received after the fact) gates were changed an average of 3x per flight all flights delayed (in some cases cancelled altogether) - my wife an I ended up on separate flights! - and departure information was inconsistent - i.e. big electronic display says flight gate F33 at 7.10pm little concourse display says gate F27 at 5.35pm and actual gate sign says 6.35pm and attendant says ""Oh the displays aren't updated very often"". The overall experience - coming and going - was flabbergasting. It's hard to understand how an organization can be so broken. I think what startled me the most is that the ground staff had so little regard for the degree in which they were trashing people's schedules vacations honeymoons etc. In fairness I'll say that the actual flight (once we got on one) was fine - nothing special but nothing horrible either - but getting to the flight transferring between flights luggage handling luggage problem handling responsiveness to client's was just plain horrible verging on criminal."
10479,US Airways,21-May-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I am long time US flyer with over 326 000 miles earned on this airline I know the airline and its product and policies well and I must say I will do everything I can to never fly USAir (or American if the post-merger product is anything like USAir) again. Staff on long haul international flights (PHL-LHR) and (LHR-PHL) are not only rude and unprofessional they seem to have disdain for their customers. One does not expect personalized attention in Economy but even in this class of service this was still a $1400 ticket and quite frankly I expect better service for that kind of money. Multiple requests to have a personal wheelchair stored in the cabin coat closet (as every other international airline does) were ignored on not one but 3 separate occasions. Disabled passengers and mothers with infants were treated with complete disdain on both US Airways Flight 728 (5/17/13) and US Airways flight 729 (5/20/13). I fly frequently and am generally pretty tolerant of the hassles of flying nowadays however flying on US Airways between the US and Europe was truly the low point of my trip. The fact that both the outbound and the return flights were characterized by such poorly trained staff tells me this is an endemic problem. Their international product truly is garbage no matter what the fare is.
10480,US Airways,21-May-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Was scheduled to fly from NY to Orlando for my first child's graduation. Flight from NY was rescheduled due to mechanical problem. Rescheduled to fly from NY to Philadelphia connecting to another flight from Philadelphia to Orlando arrived in Philadelphia while awaiting at the gate They closed the doors never asked me anything were very unpleasant to deal with and after complaining they finally rescheduled me for another flight that was late to Orlando which resulted in me being late for my Daughters graduation. When I spoke with someone on the phone all I got was a run-around and how sorry they truly are but there is nothing we can. Supervisor after supervisor nobody was willing to make the experience even a little pleasant.
10481,US Airways,20-May-13,Puerto Rico,0,Economy,1,NO,This is the first and last time I'll fly with US Air. The delays are ridiculous. I've never seen an airline with so many problems with their planes. Both flights I took to go stateside were delayed and both returning were also delayed. I missed my last connection. I have recently returned from another trip using Southwest. What a difference.
10482,US Airways,20-May-13,USA,7,First Class,4,YES,"When I did my online check-in it asked me if I wanted to upgrade to First Class for $300. I have travelled to East Asia (China) a couple times - first time I flew coach - 3 seats wide. After the 12 hour flight home I promised myself I would never do that again. The next time went to China on United I upgraded to Business Class - wow what a difference - lay flat seats are what traveling that distance was meant to be. I upgraded my wife and myself to first class for the 6 hour flight. US Air flies a old 757 to Honolulu but I will say for me the $300 was well worth it. The seats are the old school First Class seats big ""lazy boy"" style which recline maybe 10-degrees and no foot rest but very comfy and roomy. No duvets or pillows like business class to China but normal aircraft pillow and blanket sufficed for me. Hot meal service was fine - served on glass plates - two choices (chicken or ravioli) - airplane food - United business class to China had excellent food - this was more one step up from a TV dinner but sufficed. Ice cream for desert. After dinner had a nice nap and awoke to a basket of all kinds of snacks being passed out. Plenty of drinks readily available. So was it worth $300 each for wife and I to upgrade to first class? Yes but if upgrading means you are going to have to cutback on your spending once you get to Hawaii - definitely wouldn't recommend that. Hope upgrades are available for my flight home! Tip: if you can get seats in 2F and 2 D these are bulkhead and more leg room and the shared TV is on the wall in front of you."
10483,US Airways,17-May-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,The only reason we took US Airways was because they had a non-stop to Punta Cana from Philadelphia. They charge you $25 for your luggage and lost my daughter's. We came back 5/14/13 she just got it today 5/16/13. The seats were hard and there wasn't any entertainment. It has to be the cheapest airline going. They asked if anyone wanted bottle water I said yes they gave me a Dixie cup of water. When he served me my soda he spilt it on me and didn't even say he was sorry!
10484,US Airways,15-May-13,Puerto Rico,0,Economy,1,NO,Flew from San Juan to Philadelphia connecting to Los Angeles LAX. This airline deserves to go down to the ranks of Ryanair and one star less. The PHL Agents are the most bored staff in the USA and service onboard long haul Caribbean and transcon flights limited on one and only one beverage service and that's it. What do FA's the rest of the flight? Southwest just entered service into SJU from MCO/TPA/BWI and FLL and flights are extremely full. Will avoid US Airways at all costs even if the fare at another airline is higher.
10485,US Airways,14-May-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,My recent domestic flight was so unpleasant. Late departures on all 4 legs of my trip. On last flight departing Philadelphia the gate staff were rude disorganized and apparently poorly trained. One member of the gate team showed a complete lack of compassion for a very young mother traveling alone with her infant. Body language displayed toward this young lady was deplorable. Seat was comfortable - looked to have been recently refurbished. Poor application of carry-on luggage policies travelers carrying over-sized bags and 3+ items were completely ignored. Seriously reconsidering my airline options for future travel.
10486,US Airways,13-May-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,The worst flying experience with a lack of customer service to accompany it. I waited over 4 hours to take flight on one of their planes and over 2 hours on another that was eventually cancelled while we were aboard the plane. All of this happened during one international flight. I had connecting flights for what should have been 4 flights (2 there 2 back) every single plane was late. Nothing was offered. Overall just not my cup of tea. I will never fly that airline again!
10487,US Airways,13-May-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,US Airways Philadelphia-Athens Economy Class. Just awful. But that was to be expected. US still flies ancient 767s on this route. Probably the worst transatlantic carrier around today. No entertainment system (they couldn't even get the shared TV right with movies being cut off half way and replaced with a new one) seats were old and visibly broken. I had planned to work on the flight when I discovered that my reading light was broken I was simply informed that I should have told the staff before we took off. Typical rude and unprofessional attitude that I have come to expect from the airline. No loss seeing them leave Star Alliance.
10488,US Airways,13-May-13,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,Last year I flew across the United States 28 times for work as well as flights to other parts of the US. I saw over 15 airports and flew in coach and first class (once my status got up to Gold I flew first class almost every week). I never had a cancelled flight or a missed connection and I was never more than 30 minutes late to my destination. Sometimes the flights were annoying but that was because of other passengers not the staff. My only complaint about US Air is that they don't have the extra legroom seats like United so you are forced to try to grab exit rows or pray for a bump to first class.
10489,US Airways,9-May-13,Spain,8,Economy,4,YES,MAD-PHL and return. Overall good. Both planes on time. First leg plenty of empty spaces so you can stretch. Main meal average but last minute pastrami sandwich quite tasty. Good selection of movies and music system a bit low at times. Nice crew. No lost baggage. Second leg full plane dinner ok breakfast a bit poor: muffin and coffee or juice. I didn't have to pay for the headphones. Toilets well maintained all flight long. I would fly with them again.
10490,US Airways,8-May-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I flew out of DTW to PHL at 9.30am but received an automated call at 9am stating that my connection from PHL to PIT was cancelled. Then on my way home I had a 2 hour layover in DCA. I noticed that every flight but 1 scheduled from 3.30pm to 6pm were delayed due to 'maintenance'. I'm still sitting at the airport an hour after my scheduled departure time with no updates on my flight status. Needless to say I should have driven home.
10491,Southwest Airlines,19-Jun-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"I'm a loyal Southwest flier and recently had an awful experience. While flying from BWI to JAX we were told we were about to start boarding. They boarded all pre-board passengers then shut the door claiming the plane wasn't ready to board. The loaded and unloaded all luggage for what was later explained to us as an ""oil leak"". This whole time the pre-board passengers were still on the plane with no air what-so-ever. After 15-20 minutes they boarded the rest of the passengers. They then told us that the AC wouldn't properly work because the engine was too hot so we all sat cramped in our seats sweating for the two hour flight. No moving air at all. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement."
10492,Southwest Airlines,17-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,Today was my first time flying with Southwest Airlines and I must say that I am very disappointed. Our connection flight had to be rescheduled by Southwest and by how they scheduled it we had only 30 minutes to make our next flight which turned into 2 minutes when the initial flight was delayed by the airline. Needless to say we did not make our flight. What should have been a five hour travel day turned into an all day travel day which was very long and tiresome for me especially since I am eight months pregnant. It would have made the experience a lot better if Southwest would have somehow reimbursed us for some of the flight or offered us a discount for future flights since the delays were of no fault of our own. The flight attendants were nice and the people at the ticket counters were overall nice but overall the travel experience was very disappointing. Not a fun way to start our babymoon vacation.
10493,Southwest Airlines,11-Jun-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,Haven't flown Southwest for quite a while. I am now sitting at the airport in Seattle waiting for my flight to Phoenix the flight has been delayed 3 hrs and they said there are no other flights available. It has been back and forth from a 3 hour delay to a 6 hour delay who knows what time we will actually depart. Doubt I will fly Southwest again.
10494,Southwest Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,I received an early notice that the flight was going to be delayed one hour. Okay that is not a problem. When I got on the flight one hour later I sat for another additional hour! My flight was delayed over two hours one hour was just spent sitting on the plane. Turns out Southwest overbooked the flight. The flight attendants also had no idea what was going on. While on the plane they made an announcement that if anyone would volunteer to go on a later flight they would get reimbursed and have a free round trip flight. Very disorganized. I had a rehearsal dinner to attend that I made only the last few minutes of. I doubt I will fly Southwest anymore.
10495,Southwest Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,4,NO,"After being delayed 4 hours in Raleigh Durham I caught a flight to Baltimore and on to Kansas City. I sat in an aisle seat next to a large 300+ pound man. Obviously I leaned out into the aisle to accommodate for the gentleman. My feet never were in the aisle but my shoulder was. Throughout the 2.5 hour flight I was bumped progressively harder in my shoulder 8 times by the only female flight attendant on staff. Never once when she was walking towards me from the front. Always a fast paced bump to my shoulder as she walked past me in the other direction. Never once an ""excuse me"" or a turn around to see what she'd just hit. Seemed pretty intentional after the last one before landing in KC. Maybe she would be of more use loading bags somewhere away from others?"
10496,Southwest Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Southwest Airlines has joined the ranks of all other airlines: Poor and unsupporting. Stuck my two sons in St. Louis for 24 hours due to a mechanical in Denver. Routing to Grand Rapids was via Orlando. Watch out for the fact they cannot/do not interline. United and Delta had flights open but the loaner (SWA) wont play with the others. Ended up buying them tickets on American (for less money) to get them home.
10497,Southwest Airlines,27-May-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,LGA to HOU on May 18th. Easy check-in online and baggage drop at the airport. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft. Good legroom and comfy seat. Crew were fabulous offered snacks and drinks. Although we left 20 min late from LGA we arrived at HOU 15 min earlier. Our luggage was delivered shortly afterwards.
10498,Southwest Airlines,26-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,I won't fly Southwest anymore. I was a loyal customer for 13 years. I feel this company has lost sight of there core value Customer service. The idea of adding 6 extra seats to there Boeing 737 configuration is a travesty. The loss of comfort and leg room just to pick up a few extra bucks. My luggage was lost on my last trip from SMF-PDX I was told by the customer service representative that my lost bag (golf clubs) could would not be delivered to Bend OR where I was staying. The new policy of SWA does not provide lost baggage delivery over a distance of 50 miles. So I can wait for the lost bag to arrive later that evening or they would ship it Fed Ex 2-3 business days. That's not going to work when I am only staying for 3 days. The new policy of taking your funds if you miss your flight. I thought that was the reason why the airlines were allowed to oversell flights. So now SWA will oversell the flight and reebook passengers if everyone shows up for the flight. But if you don't show up for the flight they have no problem taking your money with no refund or accommodation.
10499,Southwest Airlines,25-May-14,USA,4,Economy,4,NO,My last 4 flights out of Nashville have been delayed anyway from 45 minutes to 3 hours. I am a student and I like flying Southwest because of the flight change policy and 2 free bags. However going forward I may change my airline from Nashville to Boston. I would rather have a layover on-time then a 3 hour delay every time I fly.
10500,Southwest Airlines,21-May-14,USA,4,Economy,4,NO,I am thinking of taking a different airline for my future travels. The major reason I had chosen Southwest was the 2 free checked bags but on this last trip there was more damage to the contents of the bags then a fee would have cost me. Since I am pregnant and was tired after my flight I did not check my second bag until the next day and that is when I found the broken items. The bag did not seem damaged and the items where wrapped in towels and other clothes. Customer service said they could not do anything about it though since I did not report it within four hours. So if you choose to use them in the future check your luggage right away.
10501,Southwest Airlines,18-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Had the worst flight ever from South West. We were stuck on the plane from 9am - 7pm PST with no food. My husband 18 month old baby and I were supposed to fly from Raleigh to Portland Oregon. We noted our layovers in Houston and Kansas City and planned on getting food during the stops. When our first flight landed in Houston we were asked at stay in our seats as they would start boarding the next flight. Same thing happened in Kansas City. There was no optional food we could purchase. We were stuck trying to find whatever we could in the diaper bag to feed our little girl. We had also planned on purchasing WiFi to have our daughter watch Netflix which was also unavailable. Insult to injury the last leg of the flight when I went to change my daughter's diaper the sink in the rear bathroom was clogged and the trash was overflowing. I have tried to email Southwest Airlines in hopes to know my complaints were heard and no response. I have also tried Twitter on multiple occasions.
10502,Southwest Airlines,17-May-14,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,"Something seems to have changed at Southwest. For many years SW was the only airline we wanted to fly because: on-time schedules nice staff/crew all around good operation. Recently (week of May 8-15 '14) my family experienced sub quality performance from SW (flights from Dallas and Albuquerque to Orlando and back). Schedules were way off hours late with inaccurate updates that basically said ""we'll fly when we fly"" (weather plays into this but weather has always been an issue and procedures to deal with it efficiently as in giving accurate information should be in place. Flying out of Orlando was a total fiasco. The flight schedule boards and the gate desk showed ""on-time"" departures when in fact the departure time had already passed. Travelers were asking each other for updates from the internet. Finally the flight number completely disappeared from all boards (the SW rep at the gate said after an hour flights are dropped and that he couldn't say when the flight would take off). So 3.5 hours later our plane takes off. Connecting flights of course didn't happen because our flights were at the end of the day. In Phoenix around midnight we were dumped with no customer service desk open to help those who missed their connections to re-schedule. We were lucky enough to find one ticket rep (Homero) who was trying to go home but did help single handedly even though the counter was closed and many people were needing assistance. SW offered no vouchers for future travel and we had to find our own accommodations for the night-the info handout with a number to call for a nearby hotel recommendation with discount had little to offer with no pick-up available. My conclusion is that perhaps SW has gotten too big (with Airtran acquisition) and has lost control of some operations. SW is at its best as a short haul regional airline. Cross country flights (3 hours +) are off schedule and uncomfortable. The good news is that the staff and crew we encountered tried to be helpful but they are powerless when they don't have the information and support that they need."
10503,Southwest Airlines,17-May-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I have flown Southwest several times. This is my first time to write a review. We flew from Little Rock to Las Vegas. On the way back we were late to board and missed the flight. They put our luggage on another plane and couldn't guarantee when they would get to Little Rock. They put us on a flight to Chicago a little later every seat was full so we were lucky to get on. From Chicago we got a plane to Little Rock again the seats were full so we were lucky again. We were about five hours or so later than if we hadn't missed our original flight. All I can say the Southwest people were very nice about trying to help make the connections and when we got to Little Rock our luggage came in about forty-five minutes later. All I can say about Southwest is good. The flight attendants were very nice too all of them. When we came into Las Vegas the plane went over the Hoover Dam with a very good view I made a comment about the view when I got off and told the pilot I was hoping for a circle around the dam he told me they frowned on that since it would take about another thousand bucks. A little humor thrown in. When I fly it will be with Southwest I have never had any trouble.
10504,Southwest Airlines,12-May-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,This is the first and last time I will fly Southwest. Our flight was delayed from L.A. to Chicago and our connecting flight was also delayed. The connection left an hour earlier than the listed time on the website. The next available flight was 17hrs later. The customer service agents were rude condescending and were of no help at all. We rented a car to drive 12 hours home but not before waiting 4 hours for our luggage. This service is shameful. I will never fly Southwest again and I would never recommend this airline.
10505,Southwest Airlines,9-May-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I will never fly this Airline again. Flight 37 was to take off at 4.50pm from Houston to Atlanta and due to weather conditions it was delayed which was understandable. However we were never updated on the flight we kept being told that the flight was in route when it apparently wasn't and finally after 5 hours the plane arrived from Dallas - a 1 hour flight. Then we were told after it arrived that the Pilot had timed out and couldn't fly anymore. Just lies and more lies and finally a Supervisor informed us that another flight was supposed to arrive at 12.10 am and at this point we are still waiting. There was no accurate information disseminated at no time! I understand that things happen but accurate communication is essential but this was totally ridiculous and unacceptable!
10506,Southwest Airlines,7-May-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,"Flight 490 Tampa to Albany NY. April 30 2014. Love the free two bags at check-in. Hate the 737-700 seats. I'm 6' 2"" 230 lbs. there is no way I can sit and be comfortable. Those seats are ridiculous."
10507,Southwest Airlines,5-May-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,This was the first and last time I plan to fly with Southwest/Transair. The plane was dirty and noisy. The staff were not pleasant and spent most of their time talking. The internet was so weak the my husband could not watch the show he wanted to without it stalling every few minutes and he could only get the dialogue with a frozen screen. It was a waste of ten dollars for a service that did not work. I am only 5 feet 2 but I could not even get my legs comfortable. There was not choice for a snack and not everyone likes or can have pretzels on their diet. When we exited the plane only one staff member was anywhere near the door but she was not greeting passengers she was cleaning up the food area. I said goodbye and she barely looked up. The pilot did not say two words to us during the flight about where we were until we were about to land. The only good part of the whole experience was the time of day was convenient but I can find that with any airline. I will definitely be going back to the airline I have been using for decades. That way I know what I will be getting for my money. Sorry but this one bad flight put a sour taste in my mouth and wallet.
10508,Southwest Airlines,4-May-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Not very impressed. It's been my third time the flight has been delayed and I got a 15 minute heads up of course that update was completely useless as I was already being reassigned planes. Taking into consideration that nothing can be done about poor weather the boarding process is awful and the representatives at the Fort Lauderdale front desk seemed very inconvenienced that they had to re-book us. It would really have made a difference if some genuine expression was portrayed.
10509,Southwest Airlines,4-May-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,March 30th 2014. Hartford Ct. to Las Vegas. While waiting to board the flight I noticed a very angry looking male flight attendant wandering around the gate area he was on our flight and his mood didn't improve for the entire 5.5 hour flight. During a short period of relatively smooth air the crew started taking drink orders. Fortunately on the way home the crew were very pleasant with passengers. The plane was a 737-700 fairly comfortable and the free snacks were a nice surprise.
10510,Southwest Airlines,1-May-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,I think the boarding process with un-assigned seats is outdated and treats folks like cattle. You have no clue if you will be sitting with the person you are traveling with. On the first flight I had a great seating number had to be re-routed due to plane problems and was near-last on the re-routed flight. Sat in the middle seat (without my travel partner) for four hours. On the way back I checked in 20 hours in advance and was the very last person boarding. How is it that I can check in that early and every single person be seated ahead of me? Again sat in the middle and without my travel partner. The upgrade offer is nothing more than a bribe. I won't fly Southwest again.
10511,Southwest Airlines,28-Apr-14,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,"Flew St. Louis to Orlando and return. Online check in was very easy and I got an ""A"" boarding cards both times checking in 24 hours ahead of time. Planes left and arrived on time. FAs were in a good mood and very friendly. Soft drinks and pretzels and peanuts were served. Luggage was free and arrived quickly."
10512,Southwest Airlines,28-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"Sitting in SFO waiting for my surprise surprise delayed Southwest flight to Orange County. When I called them this morning to see what the delay was the agent said ""It''s SFO they're always backed up"". Funny thing is I'm here sitting with my sister who has a flight to LAX on time on Virgin airlines not to mention no delays on any of Virgin's flight out of SFO. Sure Southwest is cheaper but if you want to get some where on time or you would prefer not to spend your free time hanging out at an airport don't use Southwest. My flight here was delayed as well. In fact I don't recall an on-time flight with Southwest."
10513,Southwest Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I had my two minor sons fly from my mom's in OAK to LAX. When they arrived at the airport my mother went about getting them checked in. They were treated as if they were 18 and 25! They were not boarded separately note were they seated by flight attendants. The attendants only offered he usual snack and drink and when they deplaned they were sent off of the plane into LAX terminal unaccompanied! When I asked about the policy we were told that since our 13 year old was over the age of 11 he was responsible for our six year old traveling with him. This is a cash cow low class airline which I will never allow my kids to travel on again! Southwest flight 950 from Oakland to Los Angeles on Friday April 18 2014.
10514,Southwest Airlines,20-Apr-14,Canada,7,Economy,4,YES,BUF-MCO-BUF. The unassigned seating is such a pain because then you have flight attendants yelling at you to choose any available seat. Both flights were on a Boeing 737-300. Cramped seating but flight attendants were polite and nice once you were in the air. In-flight magazine is terrible but the free snacks ands drinks helped. Although Southwest does have some of the best baggage policies in all of North America.
10515,Southwest Airlines,20-Apr-14,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,EWR-HOU-EWR. I flew on an early flight to Houston Hobby. The flight was extremely empty and there was a ton of seats. I got A23 and A24 for that flight. Staff were quite attentive and provided us with snacks and drinks. We got into Houston around the time we should get there. Our return flight was delayed 90 minutes and we got a different plane. There were also delays at EWR so I just had to deal with it. The staff was just as attentive. Once we landed one of the flight attendants did apologize for the delay. Although I did not check any bags they got off the plane extremely quickly. I would fly them again!
10516,Southwest Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"Return trip from Denver change in Baltimore than land in Islip NY landing at 8.45pm. I did not know that the first leg of the trip was stopping in Louisville but I learned that a ""direct"" flight does not mean non-stop. Louisville to Baltimore was canceled and I was the only passenger that they let on all others were stopped and told about the situation. There was no announcement about the cancellation so when we landed in Louisville I asked the flight attendant and she sent me to the gate attendant who put me on a flight to Chicago then to LaGuardia airport landing at 12.00am. Told my luggage was left on the plane that was going to Orlando. Turns out my luggage didn't go to Orlando and was taken off in Louisville. It eventually made its way to Islip the next day. Because of the late arrival and distance from home I was forced to get a car service at a cost of $120."
10517,Southwest Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,I have avoided using Southwest in the past as I don't like lines pushing and shoving or unassigned seating. Nonetheless after hearing about SWA's Business Select Class I decided to give them a try. For about $60 more than the walk-up fare Business Select guarantees the passenger a boarding pass in the A1-A15 group thus being among the first to board. I was thrilled when I checked in online and received boarding pass A-1. The gate room seemed fairly empty and Southwest agents were hawking upgrades for $40 to anyone wanting to move up in the short boarding line. Upon boarding the aircraft I discovered that there were already 90 through passengers already on the airplane. Little overhead space available and mostly middle seats. Although the staff was affable and tried their best I found this to be an extremely uncomfortable way to travel and recommend strongly against wasting money for Business Select.
10518,Southwest Airlines,15-Apr-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,The airline is fine as far as on time baggage goes through quickly staff are friendly and helpful. However the boarding procedure (no assigned seats) is just a way to charge people for a reasonable line placement. So when considering flying SW with a family that would like sitting together add from 15 to 40 dollars to the price of a ticket and purchase the upgrade. All and all a fine airline for those flying alone but not family friendly.
10519,Southwest Airlines,4-Apr-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Southwest 1696 on April 1st from Baltimore to Denver. By using the rapid rewards debit card we got throughout the year we are able to take a vacation for no more than $30 each year ($30 is tax). We always check in on the dot of 24 hours before departure and usually get A or B boarding groups. We love that we get to choose our own seat. The staff are always very friendly and the new free TV on board every flight is my 2 kids favorite past time.
10520,Southwest Airlines,3-Apr-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I was horrified by the policy of changing flights at SouthWest. I had a round trip ticket and was able to return home earlier so arrived at Nashville airport 11.30 looking to get on the almost empty 1.20 pm flight. I was informed that I would have to pay $250 to purchase a new ONE WAY ticket home. I paid less than that for the round-trip flight. I did not expect this since I was told that SW was customer friendly and did not charge change fees. No they just charge you for a whole new ticket instead. I am trapped in Nashville for the next 8.5 hours thanks to their policy.
10521,Southwest Airlines,18-Mar-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,Having flown 45 weeks or so annually and now sbaqng back I fly Southwest for both business and pleasure. Southwest is an easy transition. With all the cutbacks and cattle calls that airlines have migrated to SW at least makes it simple ABC. If you can't figure that out sit in the middle. Their gate attendants are knowledgeable take the same stupid questions over and over yet answer them in a polite manner.
10522,Southwest Airlines,13-Mar-14,USA,5,Economy,1,NO,My husband and I will avoid Southwest/AirTran at all costs. Vacation to Cabo 3/1/14 with connections in Denver. 1 hour late getting off ground in Milwaukee as plane was over weight and they had to kick 8 people off. Late arrival in Denver forced mad rush to gate in different terminal for connection to Cabo. Returning to Milwaukee 3/10/14 plane was 1 hour late getting in and leaving Cabo which again created havoc in Denver for connection back to Milwaukee. The absolute kicker is they lost both of our bags going to Cabo (30 hours before returned) and returning to Milwaukee (36 hours before returned). Unbelievable incompetence. Your bags fly free - you just don't know where!
10523,Southwest Airlines,13-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,3,YES,Las Vegas to Richmond VA. Booked with AirTran but transported by Southwest from LAS to ATL. Biggest problem I have with Southwest is no seat assignment. That's why I picked AirTran. With Southwest I feel like I'm treated like cattle and herded through the process of boarding the plane. I believe AirTran has the right approach for boarding. That is 1) assigned seats and 2) boarding by zones. I can't understand why the general flying public tolerates Southwest's cattle call boarding. Southwest's prices are right but their anywhere you want seating is for the birds.
10524,Southwest Airlines,13-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Vacation to Cabo San Lucas Mexico scheduled 3/1/14. Boarded in Milwaukee with a connection in Denver. When we arrived at check in we were told the flight had been 'overbooked' by 5 passengers. We received the last 2 boarding passes luckily. Upon being seated and waiting for 15 minutes the flight attendant announced that the plane was over-weight and 8 passengers would have to leave. It took another 30 minutes to adjust the weight before we took off - 1 hour after schedule. Upon arriving in Denver an hour late we had to rush to another terminal to catch our connecting flight to Cabo. Flight to Cabo went on schedule until standing at the luggage carousel our 2 pieces of checked luggage never came out. It was not until 30 hours later that our luggage finally showed up. On our return when we checked in at the airport it was announced that our plane was delayed an hour. Taking off to Denver again we realized we were facing a potential connect issue again. Once entering the U.S. we needed to go through customs in Denver before boarding our flight to Milwaukee. Once through customs you need to claim your luggage and then recheck it with Southwest/AirTran. We then had to pass through security before racing to another terminal where our gate was located because of late arrival. We boarded the plane and left for Milwaukee arriving at 10pm on-time. We then went to retrieve our luggage and once again our two bags never showed up. It took another 36 hours to get our bags delivered to our home.
10525,Southwest Airlines,3-Mar-14,USA,5,Economy,3,YES,Flew from Nashville-Houston-Dallas last Tuesday. As usual so many people have to bring their suitcases on board with them these days that we leave late. We get to Houston and our connection flight is down they finally get it fixed and we leave out almost an hour late getting into Dallas only to hear they don't know where our luggage is. We later find out that the plane had a lot of freight so they made us wait an hour for our luggage. I live 8 hours (by car) from Dallas and 2 hours from Nashville. Had I driven to Dallas I would have arrived at my hotel 2 hours before I actually got there by flying. On the return trip our flight from Dallas to St. Louis was late and I had to run to my connecting flight to get there before the door was closing. I think this airline is slipping so I intend to start looking at others after always using Southwest without checking.
10526,Southwest Airlines,28-Feb-14,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,Flown from Houston to Las Vegas last week. Everything was good (except lots of passengers were drunk and yelling). Our flight departed on time and arrived 15 min prior to schedule. I had no complaints at all for the price it was a fair trip. The return flight was delayed 40 min. Whoever is surprised by this obviously doesn't travel a lot by plane. I say for the price their flights are good don't expect feeling as royalty of course. For short trips (4 hours max.) it's pretty enjoyable.
10527,Southwest Airlines,27-Feb-14,Canada,8,Economy,5,YES,"Feb 2014 - BUF-FLL (return). We booked Southwest mainly because of the price and I was a little apprehensive about avoiding the dreaded middle and getting a decent aisle seat. We paid an extra fee for their ""early bird"" check in which in our case allowed us to board with the first 25 passengers both outbound and return. It was a 3 hour flight and that's about all of the time I would want to spend in their cramped uncomfortable seating. But for a reasonable short flight I'd book Southwest again. It's a basic no frills airline with no baggage fees and it gets you there albeit not in the most comfortable circumstances."
10528,Southwest Airlines,25-Feb-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"15 minutes before scheduled takeoff gate announces delay. 45 minutes later gate announces mechanical problems and further delays. All passenger were being re-routed. 3 hours later flight is canceled and they offer to get me home tomorrow with no compensation for delay. Its as if they said ""if our planes fly we will take you if not too bad there are no guarantees"". Finally when I asked to be booked on tomorrow's flight until I could see if I could buy a ticket on another airline I was told ""if we do we can not refund any of your money because we will have solved your problem""."
10529,Southwest Airlines,24-Feb-14,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,Our flight was 20 minutes late taking off because there was a previous flight still at the gate. As soon as the last person walked off the passengers in wheelchairs were boarded so obviously there was no time to clean the plane. The washroom was very dirty. Yesterday at 6.15 flight 1957 Ft. Myers to Chicago. Southwest was trying to keep on schedule but please clean the plane.
10530,Southwest Airlines,11-Feb-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Feb 8th flight 2178 Orange County to San Francisco. Feb 5th flight 2962 Denver to Orange County. I travel quite frequently. I rarely have to check any bags but I like having the option to do so for free if I need to. I travel twice/week for the last 2 months and I have never encountered an unpleasant flight attendant in fact I find them more than amusing. Also as someone who has flight anxiety I feel so secure when flying Southwest.
10531,Southwest Airlines,10-Feb-14,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,I recently flew round trip from Austin to Sacramento. The boarding process went smooth no delays but the flight was very uneventful. The pilot was completely silent the entire flight the flight attendant rude and very cramped seats. The return flight home was overbooked and at 100%. However the pilot and attendants were very pleasant and had a great sense of humor. I would advise that you fill up on food before you fly as there is no meal service just peanuts pretzels and mini Ritz sandwich crackers. It would be nice though if the pilot would make an announcement once in a while regarding your eta.
10532,Southwest Airlines,4-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"We signed up for flight notifications with an email address. We were told at the airport that we had been notified at 11.45 that our flight was cancelled. We had not been notified and neither had anyone else in line around us. Had we been notified we would have known not to leave for our 3 pm flight and not to waste 3 hours going to the airport and standing in line to change our flight. Why were there only 3 customer service people handling the hundreds of people standing in line? Southwest used to be the ""go to"" airline. No longer. What a disappointment. The customer service rep was polite but really could not have cared less."
10533,Southwest Airlines,28-Jan-14,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,"I fly SW from San Jose to Ft Lauderdale and back several times a year. I too have been a victim of delays due to mechanical problems and sometimes bad weather. I suspect that all airlines have these issues. I love the witty banter of the safety announcements. If you are nice to the staff they will be nice to you. It is not their job to stuff your 90 lb. carry on into the overhead bin. The pilot decides when and if beverages and snacks will be served. I am a ""senior"" and remember the old days when people didn't feel so entitled as they board in their sweat pants or worse. It takes just one or two passengers to ruin a flight."
10534,Southwest Airlines,24-Jan-14,Australia,10,Economy,5,YES,San Antonio - Las Vegas via Denver and Las Vegas - San Antonio in January. On a business class RTW ticket we did this low frills side trip with UK and US friends - they're buses with prices to match check-in at the 24 hour point gets you into the early second tier boarding queue which enabled our party of six to all travel next to their partner and all couples had one window seat with carry on in the over head lockers and all flights were full. They took their own lunch and appreciate the gratis soft drinks/coffee and unlimited pretzels. Loved the commentary from the flight deck on departure from Las Vegas and on arrival at San Antonio. For internal US travel go for it.
10535,Southwest Airlines,23-Jan-14,USA,5,Economy,3,YES,I took this airline from Houston to Orlando and while the flight was smooth I don't really like the seat arrangements. You are assigned a group so if you get a bad group then you can get on the plane with your spouse and not be able to sit together because of no available two seats together.
10536,Southwest Airlines,21-Jan-14,Slovakia,10,Economy,5,YES,"12 Jan flight 670 MDW-LGA 1.5 hrs. Low fare easy check in speedy boarding on-time professional cabin crew very good seat pitch new aircraft. Soft drinks nuts and pretzels - free of charge. Better than other ""traditional"" airlines."
10537,Southwest Airlines,20-Jan-14,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,Traveled on WN1038 25 Dec San Antonio to Orlando non-stop as a separate domestic segment making up a One World American Airlines KUL-CDG-DFW-SAT/PBI-ORD-LHR-KUL. It was a full flight to a holiday destination at the busiest time of the year. Service was the absolute minimal. Sodas were minimal with just one cup and no top-ups! Legacy carriers would offer the whole can of Dr Pepper for you to enjoy your drink. Southwest of today is definitely not the Southwest of the 80s! If you need a 2nd piece of check in bag then you might want to consider Southwest otherwise stay away.
10538,Southwest Airlines,9-Jan-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Admittedly there was a storm two days before we wanted to arrive in our destination of Indianapolis. They repeatedly lied to us and told us that the Indianapolis airport was closed when there were other airlines flying into Indianapolis from the same airport. They changed our flight 10 times. After they cancelled our flight to Indy they put us on another flight to Louisville airport after we received this confirmation the flight was reinstated but we lost our spot. They never gave us meal vouchers or paid for a hotel. They refused to get us a ticket with any other airline actually flying into Indianapolis too. All in all the worst experience I have eve had with any company.
10539,Southwest Airlines,9-Jan-14,Canada,6,Economy,4,YES,Just returned from a trip to San Jose the 1st. of January. I do not like this cattle call method of filling the seats. After finally entering plane I always look for the seats by the emergency exit due to knee problems what I found was a young girl sitting there already. When I brought my concern to the stewardess about whether or not she would be capable of opening the emergency exit she just said no problem for her to open it. The seats are not made for me and I find them very uncomfortable. I really would like to give SouthWest airlines a better score but could not.
10540,Southwest Airlines,8-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Flight 3546 Denver to Philadelphia 1/3/14. The weather was bad in Philadelphia so all flights were problematic - but SW changed the departure time over 8 times there were 5 gate changes. All we were told with all this the flight arrived 5.5 hours late in Philadelphia and the bags took another 45 minutes.
10541,Southwest Airlines,8-Jan-14,USA,0,Economy,3,NO,"Flew from Detroit on Jan 4 2013 flight 2112 to Las Vegas with my 10 year old son who is autistic and has glaucoma. Flight was delayed 2 hours while we waited for a 3rd flight attendant. The gentleman taking tickets was making jokes and doing a comedy routine once we finally got on board his parting shot was ""sorry for the delay hope you had as much fun as we did"". When we landed the flight attendants got on the PA and said ""finally"" like the passengers were responsible for the delay. Missed our connection to Burbank that flight was delayed as well but they apparently could not wait another 20 minutes or so to get the rest of the passengers on. I told the agent I'm flexible and can fly into any airport in Southern California. She seemed to be put out at having to help any of us. Their solution was to basically throw their hands in the air and put us all on standby. The did offer lodging though. Thankfully I spoke with a different agent and she was able to get us to Orange County. Have never seen a more unprofessional airline."
10542,Southwest Airlines,2-Jan-14,Australia,9,Economy,5,YES,Flew in Sept. 2013 from Nashville to Denver and later Denver to LAX. We were very impressed considering this is a budget airline. Managed to get seats in the 2nd row on both flights for both myself and my elderly mother. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive nice smooth flights new planes very clean. Were most impressed with ground crews in both Denver and LA who allowed my mother and I to board the plane before any general boarding. Will certainly fly Southwest again.
10543,Southwest Airlines,30-Dec-13,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,We flew from Minneapolis to Houston on December 14. We had weather delays so had to fly to Milwaukee / St Louis / Oklahoma City and finally into Houston Hobby in the evening. It was a hectic flight but the crew on flight 3480 were wonderful!
10544,Southwest Airlines,30-Dec-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"Dec 22 - Flt 3308 BDL to Midway and on to LAX. Dec 27 - Flt 774 to Midway Flt 1821 to BDL. Southwest's new seating to increase its profits makes it one of the most uncomfortable airlines I have flown on. They have squeezed two extra rows into a 737 to increase profits at the cost of customer comfort. I am 6'2"" and had my knees crammed against the seat in front of me. SW did offer an ""upgrade"" at check in - access to rows A 1-15 - but that would have cost my wife and me an extra $500! In addition to lack of leg room the new seats barely come to mid- thigh further increasing my discomfort. The touted benefits of no baggage fee (one bag apiece) and friendly staff are no compensation for hours of discomfort."
10545,Southwest Airlines,16-Dec-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,LAX-SFO return on 12/09/2013. I like the text message updates early in the day that let you know flights may be late. Before I even left LAX I knew my flight home from SFO would be over 1.5 hours late. That allowed me to finish up early and get back to the airport to try and catch the earlier flight. I did just that and was accommodated on the second to last flight back to LAX. Even though I used points for this trip there was no charge to take the earlier flight. Flights always have drink service and a choice of peanuts/pretzels. Even though they can be stingy when passing the snacks out they never say no when you ask for more and are always nice and polite. In addition I always ask for a kids book with wings to take home for my kid and they gave me two this time - nice touch. So while the assigned seating thing can be a drag they make up for it with outstanding service. And while I was given B51 on the earlier flight to LAX I still managed to get a window sea t so no complaints on the seating. Checking in early is key!
10546,Southwest Airlines,4-Dec-13,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I have been on several airlines in my life but Southwest Airlines in my opinion is the worst. The open seating is like a mad zoo. No control people pushing it is the worse possible way I have ever seen to board a plane. Additionally the seats are the smallest and most cramped I've been in. No leg room and a totally miserable experience. I will not fly with them anymore. They have lost me as a customer. However the flight crew is friendly.
10547,Southwest Airlines,29-Nov-13,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,I have been a Southwest customer for years and have rarely had problems. Today I was trying to get home for Thanksgiving. I have signed up to get text messages about the status of my flights and until today this has worked out fine. Until today I have received text messages informing me of flight delays which turned out to be accurate. Today I received 2 successive texts telling me that my flight was being delayed first from the original departure time of 5.25pm until 6.00pm and then of a further delay until 6.20pm. When I arrived at my gate about one hour before the scheduled departure time there was no seating available in the area of the gate from which my flight was leaving. I moved to an area of the concourse where the gates are not currently being used so I could sit and elevate my feet. I was actually sitting there when the second text came telling me of the delay until 6.20pm. At 6.10 I got up and walked down to my gate. When I arrived I discovered that the plane had actually departed at 5.50 before I received the second text. When I spoke with the person at the Customer Service desk I was told that I should not have left the gate and that the announcement that the plane was actually leaving at the originally scheduled time could not be heard in the area where I had been sitting. When I asked why I had received a second text message telling me of a further delay after the flight had actually left I was told that the texts are computer generated and are for my convenience only. I was aware that the plane might actually depart later than the time given in the text message but it had never occurred to me that it might depart earlier than the time predicted by the texts. I was told that my options were to wait for ten next flight which was due in about two hours fly to Baltimore for a layover then fly to Nashville and arrive at my destination a little before mid-night or pay for a hotel room and take a flight in the morning. I could not face several more hours of great discomfort so I am spending tonight in the Microtel without luggage or medication.
10548,Southwest Airlines,15-Nov-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,"Great customer service! After being messed around by United once again where they left me stranded in St Louis I booked a flight at the airport to Philly (though I really wanted to go to Newark where United was supposed to take me). As I went to the gate for my flight leaving 45 minutes after I booked it I saw the flight to Newark that was supposed to depart 10 minutes before I arrived at the airport had been delayed and was now leaving in 5 minutes. Went to gate agent explained I was screwed by United and really wanted to go to Newark he said ""No problem"" switched me to the Newark flight and handed me the ticket. When I asked how much he said ""No charge have a nice flight""."
10549,Southwest Airlines,14-Nov-13,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,Delayed 4 hours each way from Philadelphia to California. No explanation whatsoever. They put me on a different flight and my luggage on the original flight and then lost my luggage! I would rather walk than take Southwest.
10550,Southwest Airlines,10-Nov-13,Germany,7,Economy,4,YES,I fly with Southwest Airlines frequently. In fact I hardly ever fly with any other US carrier. This does not mean that I love the airline merely that by US standards it is not bad. Some flights go well and the crew are a lot of fun. This was especially the case on both flights I took on 28 October from San Francisco to Phoenix and from Phoenix to Minneapolis. The crew were friendly told jokes and made me feel almost refreshed despite having a long Osaka-Hong Kong-San Francisco flight the day before. At times the flights either leave much to be desired or can be almost horrific as was the case on both flights I took with them on the 7th of October -- Minneapolis to Phoenix Phoenix to San Francisco. Surly crews with terrible service. Those two flights drained me more than the flight to Hong Kong despite having less than half the travelling time combined. Most flights are fairly pleasant if unremarkable. Despite the hits and misses I will likely continue flying with Southwest Airlines because they do not charge as many fees and generally speaking do their job with greater efficiency than any other domestic US carrier.
10551,Southwest Airlines,6-Nov-13,USA,1,Business,2,NO,Flight 3246 from Chicago Midway to Columbus Ohio on 11/4/13.�They used to be the cheapest: no longer. They used to have the best service: now they are going to start charging for bags. They used to be on time: I'm sitting 3 hours late in an airport for the 6th time in 4 months! �
10552,Southwest Airlines,29-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I flew 10/24 flt 440 FLL to PVD. We actually arrived early! Everyone from baggage check to flight attendants to flight crew were extremely nice. Same way on the trip home on 10/28 flight 3761. Both planes were full but it was organized and ran smoothly. Excellent value (free baggage etc). I would take Southwest again just based on the employee attitudes.
10553,Southwest Airlines,26-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I am so disappointed. I used to rave about Southwest but things have taken a turn for the worse! First flight out at 7am and the plane had 'mechanical issues' so we were delayed. We missed our connecting flight. As we were deplaning the flight staff informed us that they held the Southwest connection for those 31 passengers going to Las Vegas however since there were only 19 of us headed to LAX we had to be rebooked. They proceeded to take us to Fort Lauderdale with an ensuing 7 hour layover and then a delay on the tarmac for another hour! I think the worst part was not once did any Southwest employee acknowledge our inconvenience.
10554,Southwest Airlines,24-Oct-13,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,Took flight 2009 from Las Vegas 10/33/2013. Told flight was delayed 30 minutes ended up being over an hour and a half. We were waiting on luggage to arrive from another flight. There were approx. 15-20 people trying to make connections in Austin and they were holding the plane for luggage. Usually great flights not this one. Will have to think twice before flying SW again.
10555,Southwest Airlines,16-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,My husband for the first time booked three flights with Southwest. We flew from Orlando to New Orleans from New Orleans to Dallas then from Dallas back to Orlando. We were very pleased with the service and we agreed that every seat on a Southwest flight IS compatible to flying first class with any other carrier. They all should take note IJS. You must remember to print your boarding pass 24 hours prior to your flight departure this will determine your boarding zone. The check in was so smooth! No need to fly with any other carrier.
10556,Southwest Airlines,8-Oct-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Yesterday 10/6/2013 my husband and I traveled on flight #320 from Phoenix to SF and although the trip was smooth and uneventful we were disappointed that throughout the entire flight (except the last few minutes for landing) the lights in the cabin were dimmed a bit but were never turned completely off. I can only speak for the two of us but I found it very annoying and not relaxing at all. It turned our two hour flight (that I was looking forward to closing my eyes and relaxing) to one in which I was looking at my watch frequently anxious for the flight to end. Disappointing for sure!
10557,Southwest Airlines,8-Oct-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I flew Southwest today for the first time. Flight 905 LGA to Chicago Midway. Easy check in online pre-queue at the airport. Seats are comfortable with decent legroom clean and new aircraft professional cabin crew. Left 5 min late due ramp congestion but arrived in Midway 20 min earlier. Will fly with them again and certainly would recommend.
10558,Southwest Airlines,4-Oct-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Birmingham AL to Orlando FL on Oct. 2 2013. Flight number 243. Southwest has fallen into the cattle service crowd. Not only nothing special here their cute casual personality now falls short and is boring. Non service oriented on the plane and even worse in re-shuffling flight schedules for maximum load making paying customers wait in airports because their original flight get canceled. A value no longer all the best I'm flying with someone who cares about my loyalty.
10559,Southwest Airlines,2-Oct-13,UK,5,Economy,4,YES,Three recent trips on Southwest (AUS-DEN DEN-SMF SFO-PHX). All three were delayed with times ranging from an acceptable 20 mins to a nail biting 75 mins delay which meant we almost missed our connecting flight. Gate agents were all friendly and kept us informed. On board was a different matter with rarely a smile from the flight attendants. Southwest used to be so different from the competition but I don't think this is the case anymore. Free checked bags is certainly an advantage though.
10560,Southwest Airlines,20-Sep-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,This was our first time with Southwest round-trip from DEN-LAX both flights left and arrived on time. There were no problems or delays with boarding. Check-in and baggage check-in very efficient. This was wonderful considering that we have often flown United USAir American Delta and not once did the plane leave on time and had problems with loading. The crew were polite and courteous unlike those other US airlines we have flown.
10561,Southwest Airlines,16-Sep-13,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,I recently flew to New York City and my airport was LaGuardia. The flight to New York was fine and went without a problem. However my return flight home where I was on a time crunch was quite different. I recognize that the delay in getting home was due to lighting strikes in the area not an organizational management issue of SW and for safety considerations all flights in and out of LaGuardia were delayed. The terminal at LaGuardia is far too small to accommodate the business for Southwest especially when an unforeseen event occurs as in this case. SW had one Customer Care representative trying to handle a large number of passengers. Finally another representative showed up. Then appeared a supervisor who decided to make an issue with his subordinate about how long his break was to be I have never witnessed such unprofessional behavior at an airline counter as this. It was unbearable in that worn out terminal - nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor in walkways and exit ways. I stood in- line again just to be given misinformation from that same supervisor/manager that there would no problem. After 5.5 hours in that crowed musty terminal I went out of security back down to the check-in counter where I found a representative who was helpful. I don't think I will take SW to New York especially via LaGuardia ever again.
10562,Southwest Airlines,16-Sep-13,New Zealand,10,Economy,5,YES,SFO-LAS. First time flying Southwest! The crew were hilarious. Great quick flight - left and arrived on time boarding was quick and efficient and the baggage arrived quickly. Loved this airline and would happily fly them as my carrier of choice for my next trip to America.
10563,Southwest Airlines,11-Sep-13,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,From Vegas back to San Francisco. In Group B I was one of the first people to board the plane. When I heard my group being called I stood in line in the right number section that was written on my boarding pass. Following the people in line in front of me I presented my boarding pass to the attendant and she responded in such a rude way I never want to fly Southwest again. As I presented my boarding pass without eye contact she handed it back to me. Instead of placing it back in my hand she practically tossed it to me landing on the ground. She instead grumbled this isn't your group. Please wait to board when I call your group. Confused I replied is this group B?&#8221; She stared at the pass for a while and responded &#8220;Oh I thought I called the wrong group!&#8221; And finally let me board. This frustrated me as the attendant didn't make eye contact with me the whole time we were talking. The captain and crew members were unprofessional and laughed many times over the main speaker when making announcements. My flight was on Sunday around 10.30am departing from Vegas. Not such a great way to end my vacation.
10564,Southwest Airlines,6-Sep-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I'm Executive Platinum with AA and as we live in Austin AA is usually our carrier of choice. Recent trip to LAS we booked Southwest for the non-stops on this round trip. Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.
10565,Southwest Airlines,5-Sep-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"Had the displeasure of flying Flight 2878 (9/2/2013) last night from Dallas to St. Louis. Flight was supposed to depart at 7.05pm but we were in the plane on the ground at 7.25pm when I got a voice mail message from Southwest Airlines to tell me that the flight would leave at 7.25pm. Flight taxied out at 7.35pm and got in position to take off when the flight crew declared a ""Medical Emergency"" and returned to the terminal where we sat until 8.05pm. Finally took off and landed in St. Louis at 9.30pm - 50 minutes late. Sunday night flights to St. Louis are repeatedly late."
10566,Southwest Airlines,5-Sep-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,Our first and last time using Southwest. We flew from New York (LGA) to Chicago (MDW) over the Labor Day weekend. Outbound trip was ok but the return was chaotic. Our return flight was scheduled for an 8pm departure but was delayed to 11pm due to some weather issues which we can understand. However they kept changing the departure status from 11pm to 10.30pm to 9.10pm and then to 9.45pm. When they changed it to 9.10pm this was when we had to scramble to the airport. We managed to make it to Midway but we were scattered on the plane even when we had Boarding group A. Either way it is best to avoid Southwest Airlines at all costs.
10567,Southwest Airlines,3-Sep-13,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Horrible experience coming home from Disneyworld in Orlando on Saturday August 31. The Southwest flight from Orlando to Chicago missed the connecting flight to Philadelphia by about 10 minutes. We were put on standby for the next flight to Philadelphia 4 hours later but they did not have 4 tickets for my family for that flight (but they sent our checked-in luggage back to Philadelphia on that flight). We were then told at the MDW Southwest desk that there was no flight to Philadelphia for another 3 days but that Southwest was not offering us any overnight lodging or meal vouchers. We were incredulous. At least a dozen other Philadelphians were stranded. We finally took city transit to Union Station and grabbed an Amtrak to NYC then were back home in Philadelphia Sunday night.
10568,Southwest Airlines,28-Aug-13,Canada,9,Economy,5,YES,Another pleasant set of flights on Southwest. BUF-LAS 737-700 LAS-BUF 737-800 (Sky interior with larger overhead bins). Got the seats with double leg room on both flights even with an A30/A37 boarding number. Glad I paid for Early-bird check-in. ($12.50 US each way). Bag drop a bit slow in BUF - can't understand why they don't have a dedicated bag drop line. All flights on time. Drink/snack service on all legs with an additional water service on the longer legs. Luggage delivered quickly at LAS and BUF. Already planning my next trip on Southwest.
10569,Southwest Airlines,28-Aug-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I have traveled Southwest for years. Always good service and friendly flight attendants. Recently I flew from Omaha to Las Vegas. I arrived at McCarran Airport at approximately 12.10pm. I had to get to my shuttle location by 12.30pm otherwise I would have to wait until 2pm to catch the next shuttle. I didn't think that there was anyway I could catch the 12.30pm shuttle because of the time to get the baggage off the plane. To my complete amazement the luggage arrived very quickly and I was able to get to the shuttle that left at 12.30pm.
10570,Southwest Airlines,28-Aug-13,New Zealand,10,Economy,5,YES,I've flown 12 separate flights on Southwest over the last 5 months and I have always found the flights to be pleasant. The line-up seating encourages passengers to interact and the crew have always been friendly and helpful. The on-board wi-fi for $8/day was well worth the expense and can be off-set by the fact that there is no charge for up to two 50 lb bags! Granted there is no 5-star service but Southwest provides an enjoyable experience for a great price.
10571,Southwest Airlines,23-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Definitely not for families as you will have to be seated separately throughout the plane. The initial airfare is low until you pay the extra fees for earlier check-in times so you get a chance to sit together. I checked in 2 hours early sat in the back seat where the cabin narrows very uncomfortable and my family was spread throughout the plane. To my surprise flight attendants got up after sitting in passenger allocated seating after everyone had boarded and joked about empty seats! This airline is a nightmare! However if you are traveling alone and can check in at least a week early and are comfortable with pushing shoving and being rude then maybe this airline is for you.
10572,Southwest Airlines,16-Aug-13,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,OAK - HOU round trip 73Fs both ways and I was in Seat 5F going and 4F on the return. Evolve Interior not bad and my only complaint is a lack of power ports. Cute cookies. Staff not at all bad. Only real complaint was that outbound flight was delayed but they made up for the delay in the air so even though I literally ran through HOU I did pick up my rental car before they closed for the day.
10573,Southwest Airlines,15-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"They did not hold my plane for my connecting flight. I asked the flight attendant to whisk me to the front of the plane so I could make a run for it and he said ""they'll hold the plane for you. I've worked here for 25 years and we've never just left someone behind."" Well after waiting for 100 people to deplane I made a run for it and got to the gate just as the plane was pulling away."
10574,Southwest Airlines,12-Aug-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Had a flight from MD to FL the most unorganized flight I have ever been on. It is as if they have never had a flight before! Yes it was that bad! I have been using this company for years and after this experience I will never use them again! It was simply chaos. Avoid at all cost!
10575,Southwest Airlines,9-Aug-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,August 2013 DEN-OMA-DEN. Travelled to Omaha for business trip. Plane about 80% full both flights. First time in a long time-actually can't remember when-both flights arrived on time. FAs very pleasant and helpful really nothing to criticize; would recommend based on punctuality alone.
10576,Southwest Airlines,9-Aug-13,Australia,10,Economy,5,YES,LAX-DEN-MKE-LAX. All flights worked a treat except a delay out of Denver due to fog of all things - and Denver sits at 5000 feet! Paid for early check-in and was in low A group every time. Once you understand their system and its quite logical SW is a great airline to fly with.
10577,Southwest Airlines,2-Aug-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,HOU-LGA-HOU on 737-300 both ways. Boarding was chaotic; cattle herding people onto the plane was very unusual and not efficient. Seats and aircraft were outdated. Seats were very uncomfortable and gave me little legroom. I found myself having to move around in my seat every 30 seconds. Flight attendants were slow to respond. Inflight entertainment was a SkyMall magazine free viewing of the news networks (FOX ABC etc.) free flight tracking software and slow overpriced wifi for 8 USD. Turbulence was awful coming into LGA. Only good thing about was that you get 2 bags free.
10578,Southwest Airlines,25-Jul-13,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,"July 23 flight 2528. Very poor customer service from flight attendant. I realize its been a long day for them but when customer service is 90% of your job the expectation is that you bite your younger when passengers are upset about unexpected plane changes. Her condescending ""Hun"" is unacceptable."
10579,Southwest Airlines,25-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,"My plane landed at 6pm today. I wasn't even suppose to leave the plane just board more passengers then off to Flint. Well we all had to unload and wait for them to find another pilot. For an hour were held due to weather issues. Then they decided the pilot would be with us at 9pm this was delayed until 945. So we load get ready to leave at 10.15 and then there was a ""mechanical issue"" that had to be checked. 30 mins later we finally got ready to take off. Then the pilot comes over the PA to tell us we were going back to the gate. So 11.00 at night and were waiting for them to find another pilot. Moral of the story. Save yourself time and money and don't fly Southwest."
10580,Southwest Airlines,25-Jul-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I flew from Albany NY to Oakland CA to get married. When the crew found out I was getting married I was presented with a bottle of Korbel champagne! What a lovely gesture from an airline that puts service first.
10581,Southwest Airlines,22-Jul-13,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,Southwest is not the on time airline it used to be. I was on a flight from Salt Lake City to Phoenix in march and it was delayed 5 hours. Then my children were flying from Phoenix to Providence as unaccompanied minors in June and they were on the plane and it had an issue so they had to deplane and find another airplane. They arrived 3 hours late and one hour before my husband who was also flying into Providence whose plane was delayed coming from Tampa. So the grandfather had to drive to the airport at 12.30 am to get the kids as they were unaccompanied minors. Now I am on a plane headed to Boston and it is delayed by two hours taking away they night I had planned in the city. I have been a loyal SWA customer but no more.
10582,Southwest Airlines,11-Jul-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Non-stop from Rochester to Orlando. Friendly crew. We traveled with our two children one being a toddler. The staff were friendly and courteous and checked on us several times. We didn't have any delays except on return and it was only ten minutes. I would definitely fly Southwest again!
10583,Southwest Airlines,11-Jul-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Great flight. Flew from TPA-MDW non-stop. Nothing bad on the whole flight. Had a slight delay because there was a passenger who could not find his seat. Flight had an early arrival. Would fly again.
10584,Southwest Airlines,9-Jul-13,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,I fly every other week and have been a loyal SW customer for years. I have however noticed that more and more recently over the past year that my flights are delayed. I'm not sure if its an issue that arose from the AirTran acquisition or just their rapid expansion and growth but something is definitely amiss. More frequent and longer delays have me worried about the future and continuing to use SW exclusively. I have found that the best way to avoid said delays is taking one of the first few flights of the day avoiding delays that seem not to stem from weather/mechanical issues but rather confusion that just seems to pick up steam throughout the day. If you don't like to wake up early bring a good book!
10585,Southwest Airlines,9-Jul-13,Ireland,9,Economy,5,YES,Nashville-New Orleans on July 1st. Slightly delayed due to weather where the incoming plan left from but after that it was good. Free soft drink snack and checked bag can't believe Ryanair are based on Southwest worlds apart.
10586,Southwest Airlines,4-Jul-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,This is one of the worst customer care I have seen I booked my a flight for my children (12 and 9) as junior travelers because SWA had told me they would allow my sister to pick them up at the gate and they do not need someone there through out the flight. Flight delayed an hour and did not allow my sister to the gate. SWA personnel told her they would bring back the kids. However when my sister saw the woman (without the kids) her answer was they did not pay the fee. SWA left them to sort it out on their own at 2am at Boston airport!
10587,Southwest Airlines,22-Jun-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I am from Tucson and live in San Diego. I make about 3 trips per year back to Tucson and usually drive every time. I decided to try flying to save time. The car picked me up at 6.55pm on 6/12 for flight 499 from SAN to TUS (9.05 flight time). I waited in the Airport for 2 hours until we finally boarded at 9.15pm sat on runway for 20 minutes and finally took off at 9.42pm. Again the flight was supposed to take off at 9.05pm. Crew were unapologetic and slow moving. We didn't land until 10.50pm. On the way back to San Diego on flight 1858 we were supposed to leave at 9.30am. It is 9.39am now and the estimated departure is now 10.15am. I have heard no updates from staff. No announcements. I will never fly Southwest again.
10588,Southwest Airlines,20-Jun-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,My flight to Chicago from Ft. Lauderdale via St. Louis 5/12-13/2013 was interrupted by extremely bad weather in Chicago at MDW. Southwest staff were very involved in getting myself and all the other passengers on Flt 352 to our destination. I did arrive late but did indeed arrive and so did my luggage.
10589,Southwest Airlines,20-Jun-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,23-27 May 2013 Columbus OH - CMH to Ft. Lauderdale FL - FLL. Southwest is our preferred airline and we fly 3-5 times a year. Every time we've used another airline (because someone else was booking the flights or Southwest flights for the times we needed were full) we've regretted it. When we first flew Southwest it took us awhile to get used to how seats are chosen because we'd always flown airlines that had assigned seats. Now we just pay the extra $10 per person for early boarding and make friends with the people around us who are waiting to board. We love how friendly the flight crews are and that their fun personalities come through during the flights. They are funny personable helpful. During one flight there was loud knocking on the outside of the plane which caused the plane to be re-routed to change planes. Southwest gave us a credit for the trouble without us asking.
10590,Southwest Airlines,13-Jun-13,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,I had a connection in ATL on my way to BWI after taxiing out we went back to the gate with mechanical issues. The de-icer warning light came on. They told us we would have to wait for the plane to be fixed as there were no available planes after de-boarding they said they had found another plane for us. It got us to our destination 5 hours late I missed my shuttle and had to rent a car to arrive at my destination on time. I called SWA and they willingly issued me a travel voucher for $300 to cover the cost of the car. I was happy with this compromise although cash would have been best. The crew etc were fine no issues there. The only thing I can say and it might be too critical is I would have expected them to be more proactive about reimbursing for the inconvenience.
10591,Southwest Airlines,11-Jun-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,CLE-MCI with a stopover at MDW. The flight crew were attentive and nice and the plane a Boeing 737-700 was very clean.
10592,Southwest Airlines,29-May-13,USA,3,Economy,4,NO,I will never fly Southwest again even though they were $300 cheaper than the opposition. I have never had this many flight delays in my 10 years of flying combined that I have had with SWA in the last 2 days! The weather has been good! If you want to save money and don't care about things like arriving/departing on time they aren't that bad. Also I am not a fan of the royal rumble/every man for his own seat scenario that plays out every flight. I sincerely felt as if we were playing musical chair every time that we dumped off another filled-to the seats load that we just picked up on our fourth stop. Putting my bag way in the front and then hiking to the back for my seat wasn't a blast either. All in all the savings in my opinion does not warrant the lack of professional services that should be granted from an airline.
10593,Southwest Airlines,28-May-13,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"LAX-LAS-DEN flight delayed due to mechanical problems. After a 2 hr delay gate agent announced we would receive $100 vouchers off future travel. We couldn't re-book on the next flight as it was full. Unfortunately problem was not fixed and flight was canceled 4 hrs after scheduled departure. We were re-booked and arrived 6 hours late. While I understand mechanical issues happen such a long delay is unacceptable on a short 1 hr flight such as LAX-LAS. Southwest should have been able to swap out an aircraft at a major hub such as LAX. Prompt re-booking when the problem was first discovered could have got passengers to their destinations sooner. Otherwise cabin was clean and In-flight service good featuring pretzels peanuts and complimentary soft drinks. The new ""Evolve"" seating is uncomfortable and cramped with 31"" pitch. Admittedly such a lengthy delay is not customary for Southwest but their overall punctuality and cabin comfort has deteriorated in the past few years."
10594,Southwest Airlines,28-May-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I'm consistency taking Southwest out of Midway to a variety of different places (LAX PHX ABQ DEN HOU LAS) and its usually the redeye. I can always judge the best and worst of airlines based on their customer service during their redeye hours. Airlines staff have always been friendly and accommodating. My partner for example was feeling ill after a trip and he was granted an early boarding pass after explaining his situation to the boarding crew. You also can't beat two free bags and no change fees; I was able to use the funds from a canceled flight towards another. Rewards program is pretty good too especially if you have a Southwest card.
10595,Southwest Airlines,28-May-13,Brazil,5,Economy,3,YES,LAS-SEA first time flying Southwest my whole experience should be described as a visit to the zoo you line to the check in kiosks at airport where you print your boarding pass and insert the bags into the system then line again to see the agent with your tags the funny part is yet to come! Boarding process as someone here said is a cattle car thing they board by groups and family traveling together in different groups start scenes on the gate it delays everything. Onboard crew not well groomed I had the impression they hated being there. The more I fly American legacy carriers the more I stop complaining about Brazilian airlines.
10596,Southwest Airlines,22-May-13,USA,0,Economy,4,NO,I fly Southwest a lot even though I don't like their cattle car boarding procedure. My latest problem with them is their customer service or lack of. I had a flight scheduled from Little Rock to Houston which was delayed 50 minutes so would miss my connection in Houston. Called to reschedule for the next day and was told I would have to pay an extra $170 for changing my flight. They offered no help and insisted I would have to pay the upgrade fee even though they had plenty of seats on flights the next day. If the flight had been delayed an hour instead of 50 minutes they would've changed my flight free!
10597,Southwest Airlines,21-May-13,USA,4,Economy,4,YES,Badly handled 3-hour delay CMH to DEN flight. This is the first time in my history with Southwest so I don't know who to blame for the misinformation lack of information and lack of concern from the CMH ground personnel. Obviously my unfailing praise for Southwest has been tempered. I hope they do some personnel training so future passengers are treated better. Date of this was 5/20/13.
10598,Southwest Airlines,21-May-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,Southwest airlines was able to give me the worst experience I ever had flying in an airplane which is very difficult considering I am on a flight 3-4 days a week. This was on Flight 110 from FLL to BNA on May 20 the flight was initially delayed for a short period of time due to ground delay and then a ground stop. However 60 minutes into waiting on the runway the flight had to return to the gate because they were out of required fuel. I have spent my share of long waits on runway but never had a flight turnback for fuel for a delay of 60-90 mins. This speaks about Southwest's abject lack of focus on customer service and complete focus on economics. The flight pushed back from gate after 1.20pm even though the gate was closed 5-10 mins before it and its now 3.03pm we are parked at the gate waiting for fuel refill. There hasn't been a single word or indication of when the expected time of departure or ETA is and the flight staff seem to be only smiling at our misery.
10599,Southwest Airlines,16-May-13,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,RNO-ONT-RNO. All flights on time if not a little early. Staff pleasant ground crew pleasant. Made a brief stop in Vegas on the way to Ontario and a brief stop in Oakland on the way back. Very quick turn around times. Full flights on all sectors and staff even managed to do a quick beverage service on a 35 minute flight. Southwest has a good product and I will continue to be a pleased customer.
10600,Southwest Airlines,14-May-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Take Southwest weekly from Portland OR to Las Vegas. Flights in the morning have been on time. Late night returns have run from 45 mins to 2 hours delayed. Flight crews are excellent and professional. 4 non-stops between Portland and Las Vegas during the work week 2 bags checked bags free and no change fees keep me a loyal customer. Besides the later return flights and Southwest frequent schedule changes I have nothing but praise for this airline.
10601,Southwest Airlines,9-May-13,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Columbus ticket counter was rude and condescending. Flight was delayed getting to Chicago. On leg from Chicago to PDX our previous flight delay made us the last to enter the plane. We were traveling with a 6 week old baby and a 4 year old. The flight crew did not try to help us by asking people to move seats so we were separated for the flight. It was a terrible experience. It has been a while since we flew SW but I can say that we will avoid this airline as much as possible.
10602,Southwest Airlines,9-May-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,Excellent fare! I flew round-trip from DAL (Dallas Love Field) to SEA (Seattle) for $228. round-trip. All flights arrived within 10 minutes of scheduled times. The flights in both directions stopped in Albuquerque. Inflight service was consistent. We had crew changes in ABQ in both directions. Although all crews were fine some were better than others.
10603,Southwest Airlines,22-Apr-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,We had an issue with our tickets and time our flight was to leave Indy Southwest had cancelled our original flight but had not notified us that our flight was leaving at 6.45 vs 8.10 therefore we missed our flight. The Southwest staff at Indy were very apologetic and helpful they placed on the next flight out which was a direct flight bought us breakfast and gave us vouchers to use in the future. Flight crew on this flight were excellent!
10604,Southwest Airlines,17-Apr-13,USA,0,Economy,0,NO,Horrible experience we sat in the plane for an hour only to realize that the flight was cancelled because a small plastic emergency sign would not illuminate! I suspect there was more to it than that because the plane was empty on around 20 people on board. Everyone on board suspected that they cancelled this flight because it was empty. There were no more flights out that night and we had to be in Phoenix by 7:30 am for a competition. So after getting the cold shoulder from the front desk and a voucher that she was to lazy to put in my name and she couldn't refund our flight! (we had to do that the next day). We drove all night to make the competition the next morning.
10605,Southwest Airlines,17-Apr-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,I have taken several flights recently from Denver to Burbank CA. Each time we left on time and usually arrival ahead of time. The Early Bird Check-in is well worth the few dollars. Having two free bags to check-in enabled me to avoid the part I usually dread - hoisting the bag into the overhead locker. The customer service was great! The other thing I really appreciate is having porters at the airport to check in the bags.
10606,Southwest Airlines,4-Apr-13,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,Five flights over the last two weeks Islip to BWI to ATL to MDW to LAX then San Diego to Oakland all left and arrived on time effortless check in. Comfortable seats and reasonable leg room. All in all an experience that beats all other US domestic carriers. I have platinum elite status with another carrier here but for domestic flights Southwest beat them hands down.
10607,Southwest Airlines,3-Apr-13,USA,2,Economy,3,YES,LHR-MIA 11 June 777-300ER in Main Cabin Extra. I read a lot of complaints about American but it is an American airline serving American tastes. It has no desire to compete with the significantly better Asian and Mid East airlines and it would seem quite happy with its 3-star rating. So don't expect too much! Main cabin extra is excellent and as my husband is a permanent gold card holder we were able to select these at no extra cost. The seats are wider and very comfortable. The extra legroom is a bonus. Everything else is as in economy. The IFE on the -300 is very swish with a large screen and huge content a marked improvement over the -200 and the 767. I've always found that if you are nice to the staff they are nice in return and this was the case on this flight. The service was prompt and efficient the food acceptable and staff were present throughout the flight. Take off and landing were about on time. Be nice keep your expectations reasonable and its ok.
10608,Southwest Airlines,26-Mar-13,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,I booked a flight from LAX to Raleigh-Durham NC. 24 hours before the flight I went on the AA web site to 'Check- in' and obtain my 'Boarding Pass'. When I selected the option to check-in I was asked if I wanted to select a seat. I elected yes and was presented which several options for only 'Paid Seats' at $86/per seat. Thinking there were no other options I selected a seat and paid the $86 for both the departing and return trips. After making and paying $172 for seats the web site asked if I wanted my boarding pass. I said yes and I was offered the option for seat selections that required no extra fee. Feeling set-up wondering why I was not offered options for all available seats from the beginning I called the AA Customer service group and the agent informed me that they could not do anything about changing my seat to one that did not require an extra fee. I then wrote them to ask why I was lead into believing I could only purchase a seat when free seats were available they simply said 'you made the decision to purchase the seat and therefore there is nothing that can do'. After this frustrating experience on the outbound flight I requested a 'bloody mary mix' just after the stewardess handed one to the stewardess covering the first class group. I was informed that they no longer had any more. Things on the return flight were equally as bad. I was unable to print a boarding pass - web message said my reservation had been cancelled. When I attempted to call the customer service group at 11.00 pm EDT the auto attendant informed me that wait time to talk with an agent was 35 minutes. Needless to say after these experiences I will never fly this airline again.
10609,Southwest Airlines,25-Mar-13,Australia,9,Economy,5,YES,MIA-LHR 16 June 777-200. Used miles to upgrade from economy. Call centre staff very helpful with this. Our flight didn't have enough upgrades available for both of us but she checked the next flight and found two. We paid a small extra charge to change flights in addition to the usual miles and co-pay but well worth it. We were originally returning on the -300 so a bit disappointed. The 2-3-2 configuration is now old hat as are the seats. American made a big mistake not going for fully flat bed seats when they bought the -200 and the angle flat seats are very out of date. Having said that they were very comfortable with huge legroom. The angle is not as bad as some I've been on though and I managed several hours sleep overnight. Lots of space and a bit of room for your bits and pieces. Service was rushed on takeoff which I assume was because the flight left at 21.20 and they wanted to allow everyone to sleep as soon as possible. Lights were out before we asked for coffee and cognac but staff willing to continue serving us as long as were wanted. Staff were visible all night as far as I could see. Be nice to the staff and they will usually be nice to you. Almost always works as it did on this flight. Food was only average certainly not what I expect for business class - grossly overcooked steak destroyed broccoli thing and something else I couldn't identify. Breakfast was a lovely omelette but it came with another grossly overcooked and dry bit of steak. It was all well presented and served however with good crockery flatware and glass wine glasses. Interesting that they did trolley service rather than tray service I have previously had on American. IFE on the -200 is dated with a reasonable screen size but limited selection of movies. It broke down at the beginning of the flight and it took a very long reboot to get it going. Certainly not up to the standard on the -300. Bose noise-reducing headphones a great idea but they are collected an hour before landing. The map feature showing flight progress etc didn't work for the entire flight. American is not trying to be one of the significantly better Asian or Mid East airlines so don't expect it to be. Keep expectations reasonable and you will likely enjoy the flight. I did.
10610,Southwest Airlines,25-Mar-13,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,LAX-LHR. Business check-in at American's terminal at LAX is a joke. 1 person to check in everyone while 2 customer service agents hang around telling us 'they're going as fast as they can'. Security was in a tiny airless room - I couldn't quite believe this was the entrance to the terminal. Once through we passed the main spacious security check-in - it was closed. At the Admirals Club things started to look up: it's large with friendly bartenders and table service for drinks. Surprised to be restricted to 2 drinks coupons though. I'm guessing it's because there are domestic passengers in the lounge too. The plane was at a remote stand so we had to take a bus out to it - this surprises me as you would have thought that LAX-LHR was a premium route and American would want to encourage passengers. On board the cabin in business class on the 777-300 is exceptional - probably best across the Atlantic. Huge seats comfy flat bed great IFE plenty of drinks and ok food. Cabin crew friendly enough. Easy to sleep on this plane. There was a delay due to a sick passenger on the incoming flight and then a minor maintenance issue - all the movies were on so we drank and watched films. Breakfast was plentiful and really fresh. Sorry to get off at LHR!
10611,Southwest Airlines,19-Mar-13,Canada,10,Economy,5,NO,We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible. Staff were not only surly but extremely rude. In all instances the planes were old shabby and dirty with worn through upholstery and carpets defective lavatories inflight entertainment was broken reading lights did not work fresh air vents that would not open or close and the worst cabin staff I have experienced.
10612,Southwest Airlines,19-Mar-13,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,June 12 AA169 LAX-NRT F Class. Nowadays one has quite high expectations for International First Class while adequate American met none of those expectations. On all levels it met international business class standards and no more. Cabin crew was friendly but not very visible between meals. Better off in business on JAL United Singapore or even Delta. Quite a let down.
10613,Southwest Airlines,12-Mar-13,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,June 11 2014 flight 1322 Liberia Costa Rica to MIA. Worst experience ever! On our return aircraft had an engine problem delayed flight for 4 hours missed connecting flight in MIA to NYC because of this issue. Arrived at MIA at 12am and next flight was at 6am upon leaving same engine issue flight delayed 2 more hours. On top of the fact that their aircraft's are not inspected they offer no food not even a bag of chips and there's no wifi even though they say they provide it. I travel twice every year will never fly with them again!
10614,Southwest Airlines,6-Mar-13,USA,8,Economy,4,NO,I just completed a multi city international round trip with American. 2 international flights and 3 domestic. So the international (from South America to Miami) was an overnight flight. The plane was old and the ceiling TVs stayed on all night. No sleep. All of my domestic flights were either delayed re-routed or cancelled. The first from Tampa to DFW was cancelled due to no oxygen. To top it off at my final destination back in South America one bag was delayed (hopefully not lost) as it was accidentally put on a LAN flight to Lima. 5 days later I am still waiting for it.
10615,Southwest Airlines,27-Feb-13,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,"I flew from Manchester Airport to JFK in economy class. From the start the aircraft was very dated and did not smell particularly clean. The food was dull unappetising and almost thrown at you by the staff drinks were not offered except with the meal I had to beg a member of staff for a bottle of water on the journey. The IFE was very poor the TV was attached to the ceiling above the aisle so from my window seat I couldn't see the full screen so didn't get any IFE. On the return journey the same 4 episodes of ""Salvage Hunters"" was shown on a loop so repeated 3 times during the 7 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable and very cramped on the return flight the passenger in front had his seat back which meant for a very claustrophobic journey. The most startling aspect to flying with American Airlines was the rudeness of the staff! I went to the toilet and an exiting a member of staff had started serving lunch she kept shouting at me to not stand close to her (which I was not) and in the end marched me to my seat and demanded I ""sit now"". On the return I had to plead for a drink only to get a very aggressive member of staff thrust a can of juice at me before saying ""now go sit down"". After booking with BA I was disappointed to find AA codeshare and operate the flight as I was not prepared for the awful aircraft used the lack of IFE the poor quality food and the stunningly nasty approach by the cabin crew. Would never choose or recommend this airline."
10616,Southwest Airlines,22-Feb-13,USA,5,Economy,3,NO,We started in BWI with 4 delays totalling 4 hours. We finally made it to DFW and have been sitting on tarmac for almost a half hour now just a perfect end to horrible trip with AA. Tried calling customer service with a seat issue before flight and the woman hung up on me. I actually got 2 voice messages on the first 2 delays. I will not fly AA again.
10617,Southwest Airlines,13-Feb-13,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,We booked a quick weekend round trip from MIA to ORD and the trip went very well! We had requested wheelchair service both ways and they were on time and very professional. From the counter staff to the flight crew Thank you for your professionalism and courtesy.
10618,Southwest Airlines,4-Feb-13,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,Upon arrival at DFW airport my flight was supposed to depart at 10.20 pm. The flight was delayed several times and finally canceled at 12.00 am. Hotels were not offered the only option was to sleep in the airport. The next flight to my destination was scheduled for 7.30 am the following morning. At 7.20 am the next morning we learned that they had no pilot for the flight delayed again. I am very dissatisfied with AA customer service and I will no longer be flying with this company.
10619,Southwest Airlines,23-Jan-13,USA,7,Economy,0,YES,Flew ORD-MIA on April 20th. The overall experience was very average. We flew American with miles and because United's flights to South Florida are infrequent and poorly timed and AA has a lot more options. All crew that I encountered didn't seem like they cared. The flight arrived on time and bags were waiting that the carousel. The aircraft flown was a 737-800 and the seats were surprisingly comfortable. Wifi was very good and it was only 7 or 8 dollars. The north terminal at Miami is very long and if you are making a connection allot extra time.
10620,Southwest Airlines,10-Jan-13,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,"I just took this trip in fact I arrived back home last night. The trip out: went online to get boarding passes had to choose my seats (two flights). I chose my seat for the first flight no problem. Chose my seat for the second flight: $28 later I had both boarding passes. Silly me I expected when I bought my ticket that I would have a seat without paying extra not so I was in a so called ""upgrade"" seat which I didn't ask for nor did I want but that was all that was left. I did not get anything extra for having paid for a so called ""upgraded"" seat. I had to do the same thing on the return trip. Also you have to pay for your luggage. On the return trip I purchased a sandwich for $9.99 which was most definitely the worst sandwich I have ever had. I will fly Southwest when in need of a flight you purchase a fare from them you not only have a seat that you don't have to pay extra for your first bag is free."
10621,Southwest Airlines,7-Jan-13,USA,0,Economy,1,NO,I normally fly Southwest exclusively - so you can imagine the culture shock when I found myself booked (by my company) on an American flight from SFO to JFK. The only thing I can say positively is that the food was really fantastic quite unexpected for in-flight cuisine. The drinks also came very consistently. The crew were not unpleasant but not quite up to the standards of the Southwest culture. And for a completely redesigned seat the Business Class seat was the most uncomfortable thing I have endured. I am 5'1 so my feet never touched the floor. I tried every adjustment on the panel but nothing worked. Finally I just used my provided pillow to stuff behind me to make my feet touch the floor. Between that and the leg rest I was able to get a little sleep on the way home. There was no indication of how to use the video screen in front of me or any explanation of how to operate the headphone (where the jack was located etc.) or anything. I stopped flying American about 12 years ago and now I remember why.
10622,Southwest Airlines,2-Jan-13,USA,0,Economy,1,YES,JFK-LHR-JFK on BA return on code share AA flight on a new 777-300 so opportunity to compare the two airlines. The seats on AA far more comfortable than on BA greater privacy with 1-2-1 configuration free access without having to step over the neighboring passenger plus all seats facing forward something I never liked on BA set up with window seats facing backward. Inflight entertainment beats BA in every respect screens double the size appeared to be HD greater choice of movies. Food was delicious well presented good choice of wines. Ice cream sundae elevated the meal to a guilty decadence. Overall great experience and highly recommended.
10623,Southwest Airlines,4-Dec-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,LAX to Phoenix. We were really unhappy with the customer service of American Airlines employees at LAX. We had a flight coming into LAX run really late and were bumped to a later flight the next day. We arrived to the airport at 8.00 and our flight to Phoenix was departing at 9.25. I usually arrive to airports about 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and this is usually plenty of time. We checked in at the kiosk but the computer would not print the bag tags. We grabbed an airline employee who directed us to a baggage check line for others with issues with the printing. It was only four people deep so we were not too worried. After about 20 minutes and the line had barely moved we started to become nervous. We tried talking to a couple agents about taking our bags from us and sticking them on a later flight so we could still make it to our gate. They were all at the most apathetic and kept telling us there was nothing they could do. By the time we finally got to the counter we had been in line 45 minutes. There were two employees working this whole time even though the process seemed to be incredibly slow. This inefficient system and lacking customer service caused us to miss our flight. Maybe I would think this was normal airline behavior but we have flown with Alaskan airlines in LAX when a connecting flight caused us to come in late. Their employees were very helpful took our bags and sent them on a later flight and even pushed us through security to ensure we made the plane. In the end I will never chose American again if I can help it.
10624,Southwest Airlines,22-Nov-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,Upon checking in at my starting location I was informed by the AA rep that my flight was being delayed an hour to leave for O'Hare which was a problem as my connecting flight was to leave an hour and 10 minutes after arriving at O'Hare which turned into one mess up after another which would have had me reaching my final destination 2.5+ hrs after scheduled. I reached O'Hare (more delays) and eventually walked out of the airport and took a charter bus reaching my destination before the flight even left Chicago! Avoid American Airlines travelers.
10625,Southwest Airlines,21-Nov-12,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,"MIA to LGA flight. It started with a mechanical problem with the plane's intercom which they spent 2 hours trying to fix before looking for another plane. Another plane found boarded and headed to the runway around 7pm. We waited on the runway for 1.5 hours because of ""weather"" (even though other flights on the same route were taking off) then told we had to go back to the gate. One flight attendant then got into a screaming match with a passenger (extremely unprofessional) while I waited with an upset baby for 15 minutes in the roasting hot gangway because they couldn't find anyone to bring up the gate-checked strollers. Finally the ""weather"" was okay to allow us to leave but a new crew was needed we finally left around 11.30pm. And then because LGA was closed it landed at JFK instead. Nothing positive to say about this airline. To be avoided if at all possible."
10626,Southwest Airlines,8-Nov-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,Business Class trip Tokyo to Dallas. Attendants were rude! It was 45 minutes after take off before we were given audio headsets and 45 minutes before landing they gathered them up. My husband's didn't work and it was a chore to get a replacement pair. We felt like we were intruding on their day! Beverage service was a joke. This was a 12 hour flight and we were given beverages 4 times. We flew first class on various Asian airlines and the service was excellent. I will not fly American again!
10627,Southwest Airlines,8-Nov-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am. I've got no apologies form the company and was left with missing our afternoon in Washington.
10628,Southwest Airlines,5-Nov-12,USA,0,Economy,1,YES,May 30 - AA90 daytime flight ORD-LHR. 767-300. Boarding delayed as 15 min before scheduled departure the plane was just coming to the gate. Gate agents were horrible - that is the only part of the trip that was bad. Flight boarded quickly and pilot apologized for the delay. Flight attendants in economy were really great - friendly and prompt to respond to requests. Breakfast was french toast and there was a lot of food provided - I was surprised as usually breakfasts on AA Int'l are small. 2 movies shown on the overhead monitors - this is where AA fails without excuse. These planes need AVOD in each seat - end of story - period. But the service made up for it. Left Chicago 45 min late - arrived London 15 min late. Bags were already there when we got out of immigration. Good flight and service. The Purser was amazing also - helping out in both cabins and very friendly.
10629,Southwest Airlines,3-Nov-12,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,American is the worst airline I have been on. I'm sitting in the plane after boarding in Chicago having to de- board due to an oil leak after 30 minutes waiting the maintenance have the all clear took off then the pilot came over the speaker saying we need to turn back land and de-board again switch gates then it gets delayed for an hour after they told us there was an immediate plane waiting. By far the worst and stressful experience I have ever had. I will never fly with American again.
10630,Southwest Airlines,1-Nov-12,USA,10,Economy,4,YES,"LHR-DFW-SNA and return-first leg B773 very comfortable and on time AA gave us an unexpected and unasked for complimentary upgrade to MCE (very much appreciated). FA's were excellent second leg B738 was delayed by 2 hrs by storms at DFW scattering aircraft and crews everywhere AA performed miracles getting crews together. Return was on new B738 no complaints whatsoever everything to schedule however DFW-LHR on B772 was delayed approx 70 mins due to passengers trying to stow ""hand luggage"" larger than our hold luggage but again flight crew must've put the pedal to the metal as only arrived 15 mins late. Did not as one of life's great sleepers use the IFE on any legs and do not have any great expectations on airline food so wasn't disappointed."
10631,Southwest Airlines,29-Oct-12,USA,9,Business,5,NO,We flew from Las Vegas to JFK New York on 23rd May this year with American Airlines and we have never encountered such rude and unhelpful flight attendants. It was a 4.5 hour flight and they only came round with the drinks trolley once at the beginning of the flight and when I asked for some water was told that she wasn't there to run round after me! I was horrified but told her that I would follow her down to the galley and get my own water so she stormed off and brought me one back. The whole flight she was abrupt and rude. There were 6 of us in the party on holiday in 3 separate cities in USA. That was the only one where we encountered rude and nasty staff.
10632,Southwest Airlines,29-Oct-12,USA,0,Economy,3,YES,LHR-LAX. After reading about the new business class cabin on American's 777-300 we decided to book our trip with them. We made a great choice. At Heathrow there is a separate 'flagship check in' outside the main terminal which was quick calm and very quiet. The Admiral's Club at LHR is disappointing - more like a cafe/canteen with strip lighting. Anyway once on board the cabin was great - the seats are a winner with a real feeling of privacy the screen is huge and there's a big choice of films and the food was good. Crew warmed up after a while and responded well to all requests. The walk-up bar had loads of snacks and was topped up throughout. Flight was on time. Remote stand a bit of pain but I understand this is due to construction. Definitely recommend.
10633,Southwest Airlines,29-Oct-12,South Africa,10,Economy,5,NO,MXP-JFK return in economy. Boeing 767-300 was comfortable and silent service just okay seats cramped food too limited for a long range flight both inbound and outbound. Inflight entertainment just OK. Asked for upgrading purchase on return flight at check-in and was told from AA lady at counter the price was USD 7000 one way - unbelievable what a joke! Avoid AA from Milan fly Delta or Emirates.
10634,Southwest Airlines,24-Oct-12,USA,6,Economy,5,YES,Boeing 777-300 GRU-JFK First Class. True waste of money or miles until crew's sense of premium service matches product. Last night First Class service in my flight was a joke : from the warm champagne to the traffic of crew members congregated in the service area socializing quite loudly in the middle of the night; to the dirty wine glass. Unpleasant main dish and Breakfast service so rushed that it felt as if it was coach. Do not seat in 2A as crew will bother you with the curtain hitting your seat every time they march between cabins (all night long). Great product but substandard service. Stay in business.
10635,Southwest Airlines,23-Oct-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,The food was ghastly. Dallas Fort Worth to London breakfast was a measly white bread bun bare on the tray (no plate or even plastic) with butter and cheese with a small tub of yoghurt and a small orange juice. The dinner chicken tasted awful. The service from the cabin staff was abrupt and short. Some hand wipes at meal times would be great as the toilets left much to be desired. Also at meal times they would not remind passengers to put their chairbacks up like the attendants on the other airlines I mostly use. I think Qatar Airways is doing itself a disservice by aligning with American Airlines on code share flights. I particularly booked with Qatar Airways as their service is always impeccable.
10636,Southwest Airlines,17-Sep-12,USA,4,Economy,2,NO,If there was a way to rate this company's service to a score less than 1 I would do that. I booked my flight all confirmed connecting through Chicago. In Chicago after a gate change and an hour delay they cancelled the flight to my destination. No options no direction just cancelled. Then after 30 min on the call I talked to them for rebooking. Nothing available. I got someone at a kiosk to help and they booked me on a flight 2 DAYS later whereas I had to be at a conference the next morning. Needless to say that was not an option. I rented a car and drove 10 hours straight to my destination getting to my destination at 4am. Then it is time to get back home and they tell me they have canceled my return ticket because I did not complete my trip. No warning no notification nothing. Just cancelled. So I had to pay for another ticket to get back home. There were many people like me on that plane. People from across the world who couldn't even speak English and they were lost and confused. I ended up helping one of them. There is no excuse for this. This is the worst none customer service oriented company I have ever dealt with. Avoid this airline by all means even if you have to pay a little more to go with another airline.
10637,Southwest Airlines,17-Sep-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,"We flew Toronto to Chicago; paid almost $700 per ticket which was very expensive considering it was an 1.5 hour flight. When we booked the flight we thought it was through WestJet as it was advertised that way but in small writing at the bottom it said operated by American Airlines which we didn't see when we booked the flight otherwise we wouldn't have booked it. We had a very bad experience with AA a few years ago and refused to book any more flights with them. This time both flights were delayed. When returning they had oversold so my sister and I volunteered to take a later flight. That wasn't the issue. The issue was the incompetence of the staff; it took them an hour and a half to figure out how to give us our vouchers which is ridiculous because they told us we couldn't leave the gate until they gave us the voucher so we couldn't even go and have dinner or anything. On top of that the rep there kept saying she had no idea what she was doing and this was her first time doing vouchers - then get someone who knows what they're doing rather than wasting an hour just trying to figure it out yourself doesn't give us a lot of confidence in your abilities. Other issue was that they kept changing the gate to the flight (it was changed 4 times no exaggeration) and when we would go up to the desk to make sure it was there every person at the desk was extremely rude and one actually said to us ""can't you read the monitor?"" and when we explained that our ticket had a different number than what was on the monitor they gave us a dirty look and said that what they had was right (it wasn't in the end which is pathetic). it would be nice that if you were going to change the gates; at least inform people and let them know. Another minor thing was with the flight attendant she was grabbing something from the bin above my sister and her bag kept hitting my sister's head several times; and she wouldn't even apologize even though she saw it happening; she just gave us a look like how dare you sit there and be in my way when she was the one who was in our way. Very rude and terrible customer service. Will never fly again; I am not even going to use my voucher because that would mean I would have to travel again with this airline."
10638,Southwest Airlines,17-Sep-12,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,"Was delayed out of DFW to SAT last night because after a long (DFW) taxi to the runway for take off we were informed that there was an issue with one of the computers. We were all curios as to why we got so close to being in the air before this ""issue"" was noticed - it is pretty obvious it wasn't Pilot error they completey felt our pain as did the flight attendants and gate workers. Of course we were re-booking a whole (S80) plane so it was obvius that we would have to wait for a plane to dead head. Fortunately that didn't take too long and we were just 2 hours late getting into SAT. Cudos to Capt Smith and his first officer for getting us home safely and the flight attendants that had to be dead on their feet undoubtably they all had a very stressful evening."
10639,Southwest Airlines,11-Sep-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,Hope to never fly American Airlines again. I Was flying from Wichita KS to Dallas to my final destination Las Vegas on 5/18/2014. Our 3:00 flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Things happen so that was not a big deal how the situation was handled is my issue. All passengers with a connecting flight from Dallas was asked to stand in line there were about 40 to 50 passengers in line. There 2 American Airlines Rep working the counters needless to say they were very rude and short. They acted as if they were the one with the problem. They acted as if they did not care if the passengers found a connecting flight or not. I stood in line from approx 1:30 pm to 4:15pm well over 2 hours. Each Rep spent an average of 20 to 30 minutes per customer. At 4:15 2 more Reps appeared from the back however they did not have a clue what they were doing. The first guy told me that all Dallas flights were full and there was nothing available until the next morning and when I arrived in Dallas they would arrange for a hotel for the night. The person in line behind me; also going to Vegas was assisted by a different Rep who manage to find a flight for her and her 3 children. So I went back to the counter and spoke to a different Rep who was then able to find me a flight home that night. Needless to say this whole situation was very stressful and left a very bad reflection on American Airlines.
10640,Southwest Airlines,11-Sep-12,UK,10,Economy,5,NO,"First and last time I will fly AA.� Was ""bumped"" off original flight without being asked just told ""sorry you are now on next flight"".� Next flight was supposed to be in 35 mins.� I told flight attendant that if the flight was late I would miss my connecting flight she said ""sorry I don't make the rules"".� Gentleman beside me said he would gladly wait for next flight as he didn't have a connection to make.� She said ""no sorry"".� Of course the flight was delayed and I missed my connection in Chicago.� Once in Chicago I was told the next available flight was the next morning and no hotel or food voucher would be provided as it was an ""ATC"" issue not a AA issue on why there was a delay.� What is ATC I asked - Air Traffic Control.� AA had lots of people ""sleeping"" in O'Hare airport and it really was sad when you see seniors in wheelchairs having to sleep in their wheelchair because the cot they received was too low to the floor for them to lay down.� Then the kicker is at 4am security is yelling wake up time to move along sleep time is over get moving. As I said first and last time I and many others will be travelling on AA."
10641,Southwest Airlines,7-Sep-12,UK,10,Economy,4,NO,When we arrived at the airport all of the other airlines had fairly short check-in queues American Airlines filled up their queue and had a line going 30 yards down the hallway. It seemed that their computers must have shut down because the line wasn't moving. It took us two hours to get checked-in and check our bags. We would have been late for our flight but it was delayed anyway. The delay was over an hour and once we did get on the flight the seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. Our delayed flight caused us to only have 30 minutes to catch our connecting flight- which ended up leaving 10 minutes early (I am not making this up)- meaning we missed it. They issued us tickets for the next flight 3 hours later. We had confirmed seats on the ticket and everything but when we went to board the plane our tickets got flagged as invalid and we were told by the attendant that we were actually in standby- the plane ended up being full and we were not allowed on. So at this point my wife (7 months pregnant) is about to lose it and they tell us we can possibly fly out at 9 PM that evening. We do make that flight and arrive at our destination at midnight missing our evening plans and exhausting us. Again the flight itself was awful. I had taken 4 advil at this point and still had back pain. Never again American Airlines never again.
10642,Southwest Airlines,7-Sep-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,"Connecting flight from Dallas to Knoxville cancelled for ""maintenance"". Customer Service agents were clueless and basically no help and really not concerned that the flight was cancelled. Stayed in airport for 5 hours attempting to get on another flight via standby with no luck. Once it was determined I was stuck in Dallas they provided vouchers for a place to stay (can't call it a hotel) and $19 worth of food with the next flight out the next day. After waiting for the shuttle for an hour we finally were on our way for a good nights rest or so we thought. Once we arrived it was obvious this was a pay by the hour motel called ""The Night Hotel"". Wow This place was basically a brothel built around a night club. The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did."
10643,Southwest Airlines,4-Sep-12,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,"Cancun-Dallas Had a connecting flight from Dallas to Toronto which was delayed for several hours then ultimately cancelled due to ""a missing captain"". We had to re-book with an extremely rude and unsympathetic Customer Service Agent who told us that the next available flight was 10 am the next morning. We were traveling for a total of 36 hours. We were offered no compensation for the cancellation no apologies no Hotel or Meal vouchers. We had to sleep at the airport on a chair. Needless to say we will no longer ever use American Airlines to fly."
10644,Southwest Airlines,4-Sep-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,LHR-MIA-LIM-MIA in economy. I expected a poor experience and with the exception of the first leg in the 777-300 they lived up to expectations. Old aircraft with technical issues on both MIA-LIM and LIM-MIA leading to delays in both directions inedible food unfriendly and unsmiling flight attendants dirty interiors cramped seating and no attempt to be of any help. Ate nothing as my vegetarian food requests had been overlooked/ignored (despite it being on my ticket) no apology or attempt to offer an alternative. Overall a very poor partner to BA. The score of 3 is awarded because of the LHR-MIA part of the journey only.
10645,Southwest Airlines,20-Aug-12,Australia,9,Economy,5,NO,American Airlines needs to work on their sensitivity to breast feeding mom's. They insisted I check my carry on suitcase b/c I was carrying a breast pump. Even when I consolidated my bags to 2 items they would not let me board without checking my bags. Nice!! Oh to be a professional man and not have to worry about airlines trying to put obstacles in the way of feeding your baby even when you travel for work.
10646,Southwest Airlines,17-Aug-12,Brazil,7,Economy,4,NO,Toledo OH to Denver CO via one stop in Chicago (O'Hare) Trip to Denver had one delay of 3 hours at Chicago. May 7 2014 no reason given. Coming back snow storm in Denver delayed the plane takeoff by 1 hour not so bad. However when I got to Chicago the nightmare began. First flight to Toledo was delayed then cancelled. Reason who knows no 2nd pilot was the reason given. Got another flight time. Rain storm came. Two more flights delayed moved to different gate delayed then cancelled. What to do? No hotels taxi line 2 miles long. I left the boarding area so couldn't get back upstairs. Had to spend the night in a hard chair. Finally had to book a flight to Fort Wayne Indiana so I could get home. No flights to Toledo. What a nightmare experience!
10647,Southwest Airlines,15-Aug-12,USA,1,Economy,2,YES,Chicago ORD to Boston. They got me to where I wanted to go at a reasonable time at a reasonable price. Can't blame American for the delay. I didn't expect free food or free alcohol. B737-800 was fine and so was the crew.
10648,Southwest Airlines,9-Aug-12,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,Worst customer service I have had. My flight was cancelled today due to reasons that the airline had no control over but the customer service was awful. I was at O'Hare in Chicago flying to Phoenix and departing at 11.35. I left the airport today in Chicago feeling like I got stranded with no help and to fend for myself. I have never had a cancelled flight and didn't know what to do. I followed everyone else and waited to speak to an agent in line for almost 2 hours. When it was my turn to speak to someone they closed the line down and said we needed to go to the booking desk. I had no idea where that was and tried to ask. After being ignored one of the agents snapped at me and told me they couldn't help me unless I was flying to Dallas. They wouldn't even direct me on where I needed to go. I will never fly this airline again after I finally get home tomorrow. Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with.
10649,Southwest Airlines,2-Aug-12,USA,8,Economy,4,NO,"Flew May 13/14 2014 ONT-DAL-DTW. This was the worst flight experience I've had. The plane in ONT was delayed 5 hours due to maintenance causing nearly everyone to miss their connecting flight out of DAL. We had to wait in line (I waited 1.5 hours) at ONT to get on a new connecting flight out of DAL. The seats on the plane out of ONT were tiny old creaky and uncomfortable and staff were disinterested and unfriendly. There was no ""inflight entertainment"" to speak of. The worst came however when we arrived at DAL. Immediately upon disembarking we were informed that ""there are no hotel rooms left in Dallas"". The customer service reps feebly tried to console people with Nature Valley granola bars and cheaply-made cots but everyone was in a mostly miserable mood. I and many others ended up trying to sleep on chairs through the night. Very few people got any sleep. Terrible experience all around. The last time I fly American."
10650,Southwest Airlines,27-Jul-12,UK,9,Economy,5,YES,I flew from JFK to LHR with my family on 9th May. I was very pleased with the flight experience. I value a good entertainment system more which this Boeing 777 had with personal power outlet than the quality of food. There are restaurants at JFK that offer various choices. The irplane is not a restaurant. Food is a + but my values are on the seat comfort more. Seats were comfortable. Service was very efficient and fast. I also liked the dimmed cabin. Only bad thing was that the AC fan was on a quite heavy mode. Crew were mostly very friendly.
10651,Southwest Airlines,26-Jul-12,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,Traveling from Miami to Santo Domingo arrived at the airport approximately 1.5 prior to departure. First you have to queue to help yourself at one of the self-service check in machine. After waiting for approximately 10 minutes we go through the check in procedure experienced some problem and had to get help from the staff member at the check in station. In the end we were unable to check in and were asked to go to the customer service counter. The staff member at the counter asks us to wait and disappears for 5 to 10 min and when he returns he advises us that we are now to late to check in luggage as it is less than an hour before departure and we are talking about 10 minutes now. He advises us that we can fly but our luggage cannot. Only option is to take a flight the next day pay $120 to change the flight and pay for another night in a hotel. The main issue here is the rude attitude of the staff. We can accept that there are rules to be followed but the attitude of the staff is a disgrace. AA have never been a great airline but this experience is by far the worst we have ever experience with any airline. We will do our very best to avoid flying AA again.
10652,Southwest Airlines,26-Jul-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,"LHR-DFW-XNA AA51 transatlantic then American Eagle. I had avoided American Airlines transatlantic for years but thought to give the ""new"" American a try. Boeing 777-300ER already showing wear and tear in First Class. Cabin was dirty and food was inedible. Also the logic of serving lunch/dinner on an 09.30 flight utterly defeats me. Why not serve lovely breakfast? Crew was keen to get meal service over and disappear for the remainder of the flight. Flight diverted to IAH due to low fuel / weather but almost no announcements from flight deck. On American Eagle flight attendant was rude and not professionally dressed; She wore a crumpled uniform and believe it or not Dutch-style clogs. Overall it is so sad that there is no sophistication nor manner / culture at the ""new"" American Airlines. Travel on American Airlines is nowhere close to a First Class experience. This is a desperately poor airline but there isn't much choice across the pond sadly. Avoid this carrier if you can."
10653,Southwest Airlines,20-Jul-12,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,We took this airline from Raleigh to London because we expected a similar service to BA with which it codeshares. Unfortunately we were so wrong! There is firstly no modern inflight entertainment system for economy class and the food was dreadful. Onboard service was rushed and not very friendly and to top it all we had one of the flight attendants talking loudly with passengers at the back throughout the whole night. Of course that meant that even without entertainment there was also no sleeping for those of us unlucky enough to be in this attendant's vicinity.
10654,Southwest Airlines,10-Jul-12,USA,8,Economy,4,NO,LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.
10655,Southwest Airlines,5-Jul-12,USA,4,Economy,4,YES,"April 24th from MSP-DFW-SAN. No major complaints in-flight arrived close to on time. I was concerned when I was unable to check in online so I emailed customer service and they apologized for the issues they were having with the American/US Airways merger. It was all good as I was able to check us in and print our boarding passes at the airport kiosk (even though the message when I tried to check in online said ""see agent at airport""). All in all a fine experience. My next flight will be on Spirit Airlines so wish me luck."
10656,Southwest Airlines,2-Jul-12,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,Worst airline I have flown with. American Airlines should be branded a budget airline. Flew from JFK to LHR and the experience was beyond belief. Firstly I was charged an arm and leg for excess weight off my bag. Secondly the staff on AA should get training serious training and customer service skills. The food is almost non existent seats are worst in class and the TV's are approx 4inch which are well scratched and used!
10657,Southwest Airlines,2-Jul-12,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I just returned from a trip from Seattle WA to Punta Cana DR and back. I told my husband after the first plane that I would never fly American again. It was 3 planes there and 3 back. The seats were the most tiny and uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I am 5 ft 2 and 115 lbs so by no means am I a big person. The staff were awful. I have never met people so disinterested and rude. When leaving Punta Cana we sat in line for 1.5 hours because there was no one there to check us in! Every other airline were getting people through. We made it to our flight in the nick of time. We got there at 4am and didn't get to the plane until 6.25 and it left at 6.50. They were almost done boarding. I do not recommend this airline.
10658,Southwest Airlines,29-Jun-12,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,From Sacramento to Dallas 4 of us booked our trip in early January. Final destination Paris France. We tried to select seats but arrived to find our seats changed. None of us together and 1 was the very back where it was so very noisy the flight was miserable. In Dallas we switched planes (again operated by American Airlines) what was supposed to be a 2 hour layover became an 8 hour layover. The legroom was non existent and when the people in front of us tilted chairs back we could hardly move for 10 hours. miserable. I will not support American Airlines to Europe or even to Dallas. I am not sure if they have just gone downhill or what. I must commend the fellow passengers for their tolerance of such a crummy flight.
10659,Southwest Airlines,22-Jun-12,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,DFW to MOB flight AA2981 and AA3377 MOB to DFW. On our round trip flight so far 2 of the 3 aircraft's have had maintenance issues resulting in delays missed connections and waiting on standby. We have yet to hear a single apology.
10660,Southwest Airlines,21-Jun-12,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,CDG-ORD-BWI operated on a Boeing 767-300 and an Embraer 145. I have Gold status on AA so I was able to obtain a Main Cabin Extra seat on the first flight free of charge and an exit-row seat on the second flight. The ground experience at CDG was okay and they were pretty well organized. The first flight took off on-time although we had to board by bus (something that probably irritates every passenger). Cabin crew were okay and there was no IFE which I knew to expect even though practically every other carrier has it by now. The connection at ORD was amazingly painless and security was a breeze. The Eagle flight was delayed due to a late inbound aircraft but we landed a mere 30 minutes behind schedule and my checked bag was waiting for me on the carousel just 10 minutes or so after landing. All in all fairly satisfied.
10661,Southwest Airlines,18-Jun-12,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Tampa to Chicago O'Hare on 28 April. Check-in was fast but very unfriendly. Cabin crew were unfriendly and uninterested. Plane was cramped and service was almost non-existent. Only thing offered was soft-drinks. No hot drinks snacks or food available which is pretty poor for a what's scheduled as a 3 hour flight. No entertainment on offer the flight got me from A to B but that's about it. I've had better service on Ryanair. Not a great addition to the Oneworld Alliance.
10662,Southwest Airlines,15-Jun-12,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,"I am currently sitting at LAX airport and having the worst experience I had with an airline. I arrived in LA this morning by Qantas from Perth-Sydney and upon going through the ""Express Connection"" I was informed by one of the ground crew members that I would be required to take my luggage and check-in inside the terminal. When I arrived in the terminal I was sent by American Airlines employees to 3 different places to try to drop-in my baggage. When I finally arrived in the last spot (45 min prior to flight schedule time) I was informed that I wouldn't be able to check-in my bags nor take them in the cabin despite having had checked-in on-line prior to going to the airport. She them put my wife and me in ""stand-by"" list for a flight 2 hours later and checked our bags-in. I was placed in second in the list at that moment (again according to the front desk lady because I am a ""One World Sapphire Member"" and would be put in front of other people in similar situations. In the half hour preceding the boarding time our name had escalated to 6th and 7th on the list. I tried to (very politely) speak with the lady at the boarding desk 3 times but she in each time she rudely answered ""Stand-by I will be with you in a second!"" In the end she suggested that one of us should take a remaining seat and the other wait for the next flight. We decided to do that as the next flight seat wouldn't be warrant as well. Everything was dealt in a rush/unplanned manner showing AA have no control to handle such situations. Now I am here hoping to not get bumped again or get stuck in LA for the night after 16 hrs flying from Australia then meet my wife at my destination and go to the hotel to have a rest. This was my first flight with AA and certainly the last one."
10663,Southwest Airlines,15-Jun-12,USA,7,Economy,5,YES,MEX-DFW-YUL Business Class. We were lucky enough to get a discounted fare so that Business Class was a bit cheaper than the economy class fares available. On the MEX-DFW leg plane was an old and a bit worn out MD80. Good flight with a really kind and helpful flight assistant who spoke a perfect Spanish. I don't fly AA often but I must admit that I've always found nice and smiling staff both in business and economy class. Good to know that if you have an international connection via DFW you no longer need to retrieve and recheck your baggage to your final destination. We went through immigration very fast and headed for the Admiral's Club which is really disappointing: no snacks except for cookies only 1 alcoholic drink per person unfriendly staff. On the bright side wifi was good and the view on the tarmac was excellent. The DFW-YUL leg was on a newer 737 and it was an uneventful flight with a good lunch but a very poor selection of drinks. Nice staff.
10664,Southwest Airlines,13-Jun-12,USA,8,Economy,5,NO,I flew from San Francisco to Heathrow on April 26th and found the airline crew working in economy to be both unfriendly and unprofessional. The most senior of the crew had an abrupt manner I noticed on more than one occasion her behaviour towards passengers who accidentally happened to get in her way in the galley area there was no politeness shown in terms of politely asking them to move but eye rolling and heavy sighing. My pillow happened to fall into aisle without my knowledge and I was reprimanded by this senior crew member for allowing this to happen! The crew whilst serving beverages/food would not engage in any conversation or pleasantries with passengers instead they would look right through you if you smiled at them they would not smile back when I exited the economy area on leaving the plane a couple of the crew stood near the exit area and there was again no pleasantries or smiles just silence. Only on leaving the plane did a friendly crew member who I believe had been working in First Class or Business Class speak to me and said 'thanks for flying with us have a good day'. I have flown with many airlines and I have to say that my return flight home with AA was the worst experience I have ever known and because of this I will not be flying with AA again. AA show a video to their passengers before a flight which promotes the technology investments they have made in relation to improving the customer experience. I would recommend to AA that they focus more attention and investment into the training of their crew to provide a better service to their customers.
10665,Southwest Airlines,7-Jun-12,USA,8,Economy,4,YES,"Flew MIA-BCN business class. I am a long user of AA but always inside the US or from Venezuela to US. This is the first time I took AA to Europe usually when going to Spain I use Iberia. I had very low expectations but must say I was impressed. This flight was on the o767 the cabin in business is the ""old business class"" with seats that do not lie flat but I must say that it was comfortable enough to take a 4 hour sleep. Amenities kit nice and pretty. No private screen but a Samsung tablet was provided not a huge a mount of options but it was more than Ok. The biggest surprise? Food was excellent and in amounts that I have never seen before in other Business class. Plenty of bubbly. Service extraordinary FA's smiling and helpful."
10666,Southwest Airlines,5-Jun-12,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,AA flight 1612 from Phoenix to Dallas/Fort Worth was great. Plane was only 1 year old flight servers were fantastic and funny excellent beverage service and communication from captain to passengers polite timely and sincere. Really liked the comfort of the plane extra leg room soft comfortable seats and inscreen TV monitor.
10667,Southwest Airlines,30-May-12,USA,8,Economy,3,YES,Flew DFW to FRA on 777. Crew was very helpful. Nice entertainment. Good food! This is one of the best airlines in the US.
10668,Southwest Airlines,22-May-12,Australia,6,Economy,4,YES,LGA-PBI April 19th 2014 was overall great. Flight was on time and we even landed early. The crew of flight attendants and pilots were nothing great flight attendants didn't give much personal attention to the passengers it seemed. We were seated in Main Cabin Extra in the front row (8A 8B 8C). Main Cabin Extra is supposed to have 6 inches of extra legroom since we were seated in the front with the bulkhead in front of us which is really just a wall for those of you who don't know it did not feel like we had 6 inches of legroom and it felt very cramped through the whole area. If you are about to pay extra money for main cabin extra avoid the first rows which is row 8. I'm not sure about 8D 8E 8F but I assume it's the same. Also the tray tables are considerably smaller because they are stowed in the arm rest. But they are kind of cool to an airline enthusiast like myself because it feels like a first class seat. We did not have to pay for Main Cabin Extra because my family had Gold member free Main Cabin Extra so for us it didn't matter but if you have to pay for MCE I would sit any row behind 8. All in all great flight and I love American they will always be my #1 airline to fly and I would still recommend flying them just not in row 8 MCE.
10669,Southwest Airlines,22-May-12,USA,8,Economy,5,NO,My recent trip with American Airlines has made me become a United loyalist. I have sworn to myself to never fly American again. The horror started at the check-in at JFK. You'd think if there was a merger between American and US Airways that passengers could check in anywhere. No the quite literally 60 open and manned desks were for US Airways passengers only while the AA passengers had to get in line somewhere off to the side where there were two people working. On the plane a stewardess was sitting on the jump seat in the exit row and could not stop talking to a passenger in a very loud voice. Returning from LA the check-in procedure was hands down the most inefficient system I've seen in my life. Once boarded we had a plane from I don't know when but practically no one's baggage fit in the overhead compartment everyone had to check their bags and the whole thing delayed us by about thirty minutes. The stewardess must have elbowed me in the head at least a dozen times and woke me up once to ask if I'd like to drink something. No thank I was fine just sleeping. Never flying American again.
10670,Southwest Airlines,17-May-12,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Dallas to London in Business. The new AA cabin looks very good - spacious flat bed seats lots of storage and a big screen. However it was let down by slow service food that was simply not up to standard and the IFE froze and was not reset. AA has got the basics right but needs to work on the details.
10671,Southwest Airlines,15-May-12,Australia,9,Economy,5,YES,Several flights over the last month LA to Santa Fe Sioux a City Chicago Denver Las Vegas Lax Honolulu. All flights on time had preferred seating on all flights where available and could notice difference. Crew reasonably friendly although best crew LAX-HNL. Negative definitely good for purchase LAX-HNL Cheese and fruit not worth the money Turkey and & Chutney sandwich bread very dry and stale. Again not worth the money. American take a lesson from many International airlines and what they offer Economy passengers in a 5 hour sector. Would still recommend as a US Domestic carrier.
10672,Southwest Airlines,10-May-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,If you have to fly with someone don't fly with AA. They made me check in my carry on luggage and were unable to open the undercarriage door making me miss my connector flight to Atlanta. I had to stay overnight in Chicago due to their failure. I asked two different employees for a Supervisor and both of them told me there wasn't one. I had to go to a different airline and they got me an AA supervisor. The own AA employees outright lied to me about a supervisor. They scheduled me on a 6am flight the next morning and yet again they had issues. They had defuelling issues on the plane and everyone had to deboard. They are now trying to get us on a different plane. Do not fly with this company unless you want to pay a lot of money for a ticket to arrive a day later and potentially lose your luggage. Worst airline I've ever used so far.
10673,Southwest Airlines,8-May-12,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Mediocre service. Just flew from John Wayne to DFW and the flight was freezing. I asked for a blanket and was told they don't have any only to see unopened blankets on every seat in first class. I guess only first class passengers are worthy of being comfort. That really irritated me after freezing for two hours to see that they could have very easily provided a blanket. Really poor customer service. To actually say they don't have blankets when they do and you then see them.
10674,Southwest Airlines,2-May-12,USA,9,Economy,5,YES,"GRU-DFW in new 773. What a great and enjoyable flight. New plane comfortable seats excellent food huge movie selection and a wonderful crew. If this is the ""new"" American they have got it right!"
10675,Southwest Airlines,25-Apr-12,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,NYC/JFK to BUE/EZE. Flights AA953/09Apr and AA954/14Apr. Both flights departed on time and both arrived early operated with B777-200 equipment. Check in procedures at both airports efficient and quick with smiles. Seat width adequate seat pitch could use an additional inch but seat cushion comfort rock hard and unacceptable! I saw nothing international about their heralded international flagship service. The dinners served in both directions were big on flavor/taste but small in serving size. The salad ex/NYC had seen better days but the salad ex/BUE was crisp excellent and fresh. Dessert ex/NYC was a tasty pre-packaged chocolate brownie but only a 'Bon o Bon' ex/BUE. What was referred to as breakfast on both flights was a warm croissant with butter and jam served with OJ and a fruit yoghurt ex/NYC and OJ a very fresh fruit salad ex/BUE. The catering ex/BUE was of a much higher baqbre/quality than that out of NYC/JFK. On both flights the inflight cabin crews were efficiently friendly and served with smiles. Where AA really excelled was how they treated me as a WCHC wheelchair passenger. Everyone I came in contact with in both cities and inflight both AA staff and their handling agents treated me with care dignity and respect! Would have NO problem recommending AA to others for their air travel.
10676,Southwest Airlines,24-Apr-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,Nothing wrong with the service or the food but on some routes such as Barcelona to New York the planes are old and do not have individual entertainment systems. This means you have to watch whatever film is being shown on the overhead monitors making for a very long trip. There is a huge amount of competition out there so unless AA/US Air get new planes I will not be flying with them again.
10677,Southwest Airlines,22-Apr-12,USA,5,Economy,3,YES,Day trip from LGA to ORD First class. Never flown with AA before but was impressed. Lounges not as good as BA's but cabin crew delivered excellent service both ways. Outbound lunch was tasty chicken salad and cookies and dinner on the return was a tasty pasta dish with a dessert. Brandy and chocolates rounded it off very well.
10678,Southwest Airlines,21-Apr-12,Australia,9,Economy,5,NO,JFK-MIA-BOG round trip early-April 2014 in economy. American Airlines staff are consistently rude and grumpy. I am constantly surprised when once in a while there is a ground staff or cabin crew member who are actually polite and helpful.
10679,Southwest Airlines,21-Apr-12,USA,5,Economy,4,NO,"American Airlines gave away our 3 first class seats on Flight 53 from MIA to DFW on Sunday April 13 despite the fact that we were at the gate 17 minutes before flight time. The agent had already left the with the standby passengers. This caused us to miss our connecting flight to AMA and to have to overnight at DFW. Also one of our party had to fly coach even though we purchased a first class seat. I used to worry that with the merger AA 's customer service would sink to U.S. Airs level. Now I'm afraid the ""new American Airlines"" will sink to an even lower level. They sent our luggage on to our final destination. I have lifetime Platinum status on AA for having flown over 2.2 million miles with them."
10680,Southwest Airlines,16-Apr-12,UK,9,Economy,5,YES,Flew LHR to Miami on a 777 in the new business class. Seating very comfortable. It was a daytime flight so I can't comment on the seat for an overnight flight. Great service. Food very acceptable. IFE excellent. Lounge at LHR is adequate nothing more. Immigration officer at MIA was the rudest man I've come across in a long time but that's not AA's fault. Their pre-landing video suggests that the immigration staff are there to help - not!
10681,Southwest Airlines,11-Apr-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,"I travel all the time for business and booked on United for cost reasons I was flying last-minute from LGA to MSP. I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed ""on time"". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight's gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It's sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn't arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT). I will never be taking United again."
10682,Southwest Airlines,10-Apr-12,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Our trip from Quito Ecuador to Lincoln Nebraska was supposed to take 12 hours but included a four hour delay in Houston and a 9.5 hour delay in Denver. Weather was not the problem. United should have re-booked us when their mechanical failure and four hour delay was apparent in Houston. Ours was a 26 hour ordeal with many of those hours standing in line waiting for service and that was completely avoidable. What did they offer? A $7 food voucher.
10683,Southwest Airlines,9-Apr-12,Brazil,7,Economy,4,NO,"SFO-CDG-SFO. Over the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally on both United and several foreign carriers. United's First Class or Business First Class service and amenities are no better than those in economy on the foreign carriers. Outbound we didn't get drinks prior to take off as the flight attendants were spending way too much time chatting with the other passengers. The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae. The inflight entertainment worked well though it would have been nice to have different choices on the return flight. The only thing United's front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a ""but"". On the 767 the pods next to the window have very limited room for your feet when in the flat position. The aisle seats do seem to have more room. I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline. (United treats it leisure passengers very poorly - they board last often have no bin space and are generally treated shabbily.) United barely lives up to its three star rating."
10684,Southwest Airlines,28-Mar-12,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Flew from Los Angeles to London. All alcoholic drinks are charged. This is a first for me on an international flight that isn't a budget airline. The drinks service took twice as long as normal due to the charging process. Staff were clearly embarrassed by the policy and apologized for it. Will never fly United again.
10685,Southwest Airlines,27-Mar-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,I have flown this airline (on the way to Ukraine) twice in the past. This time I flew to Frankfurt Germany. Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.
10686,Southwest Airlines,12-Mar-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,Sheer incompetence to deal with cancellations. First they do not communicate them. Secondly the staff are rude and never apologizes for the inconvenience caused. Thirdly they are unable to get you onto other flights in a timely manner. How is my experience? I haven't been able to start my trip yet. A 48 hour delay so far. Two trips to the airport. Two hours on the phone. And six hours waiting in line to get a new flight plus two more to get the luggage that had already been checked in. I am trying to go on a vacation of seven days that has already been reduced to five after having paid over $3 000. I am a seasoned air traveler and have had many flights cancelled in my life. But I have never come across such incompetence and rudeness. Never again.
10687,Southwest Airlines,7-Mar-12,Australia,8,Economy,5,NO,Travelled with United on 6 flights from 23/05/2014-08/06/2014 Heathrow to Las Vegas to Hawaii and back. On the 6 flights we were only fed two meals from Heathrow to Houston and Washington to Heathrow. We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy. I asked for a small bottle of water to be told that they did not have enough so could not give me one. They did serve enough drinks on the flights so what were they doing. I will never fly with them again.
10688,Southwest Airlines,27-Jan-12,Canada,9,Economy,5,YES,We flew from IAD to BRU with United. (Boeing 777). Very nice cabin crew normal catering good flight. Flight was delayed but we got good information from the flight deck.
10689,Southwest Airlines,21-Jan-12,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,We took a business class flight from London Heathrow to Houston Bush round trip. On the flight to Houston the video screen at my seat my wife's seat and several other seats did not work at all. The flight crew tried to fix it but couldn't. They promised to have someone contact us for some credit. Never heard from them. On the return flight the seat would not recline the movies continuously skipped there was no music available and the food was awful. Flight crew tried to fix it. No luck. Flying BA from now on.
10690,Southwest Airlines,13-Jan-12,South Africa,8,Economy,5,NO,Very poor quality service. Lack of in seat entertainment on 5 hour flights even in Business class is simply unacceptable in this day and age. I was also refused access to a lounge on an international business class seat because my son in a wheelchair was flying economy on a school trip. Basic customer service would have seen the airline allow us to enter the lounge.
10691,Southwest Airlines,12-Jan-12,Canada,10,Economy,5,NO,Why is it that United is the only airline that cancelled a flight from Denver to Omaha due to weather but all the other airlines going to and from Denver only delayed? Of course because we are having poor weather they can blame it on the weather which means as a customer we cannot recoup anything from them and we have to then wait until a pm flight when we are scheduled on the first flight out of OMA. I wonder how many times this airplane has been cancelled in the last couple of weeks it sounds as if this airlines has an issue with mechanical problems and only wants to bandaid the problem. I am all for a company making money but not at the expense of the customers who are paying their bills!
10692,Southwest Airlines,6-Jan-12,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Flying EWR-NRT with Flight UA 79. Boeing 777. Punishing 14-hr flight in cramped seating condition. Everything about this plane is run down from seating to carpeting. Food is terrible and served in plastic tray covered with ripped aluminium foils. Breads are served out of bundles of plastic bags instead of bread baskets. What are we in jail? Ridiculous!
10693,Southwest Airlines,15-Dec-11,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,IAH-PTY and reverse. Pleasant staff decent food plane rather small for business class no musical options in entertainment system.
10694,Southwest Airlines,21-Nov-11,USA,7,Economy,4,YES,We flew from SFO to FRA and returned from OSL to SFO on UA. The service for these international flights was good the cabin staff helpful and professional and the flights on time. The seats in cheap economy were extremely cramped and offer little hope of rest. The flight over had a large contingent of passengers from the Indian subcontinent who did not take the hint to settle down and rest when the crew turned down the lights and yakked the night away oblivious to requests to quiet down. Not UA's fault but they could have been a bit more pro- active to settle these people back into their seats for the long flight.
10695,Southwest Airlines,18-Nov-11,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,"TPE-SFO-TPE. Economy Plus. B-777 aircraft. United has become a very average airline. Economy""plus"" seats are really not much better than normal economy especially if you can get regular economy seats near exits or bulkheads. Food was mediocre. Flight attendants were considerably older than other airlines and seemed to be worn out as evidenced by their indifferent and even sarcastic attitudes. Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes. The one saving grace for this United flight was the price which was significantly lower than other TPE-SFO non stops. So I guess you get what you pay for. Recommended for price but if you can afford it any of the Asian airlines offer better service."
10696,Southwest Airlines,1-Nov-11,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,"I recently flew in the first class section of a United Airlines 757 from Orlando to Dulles (about a 2 hour flight). The only things to like is that I arrived promptly on schedule and my seat was larger than a coach seat. Otherwise there is absolutely no reason to fly first class on United domestically. I asked for a blanket and was told after some time that ""the supervisor said we don't stock blankets on flights from Florida"". Then less than 1 minute later a different flight attendant brought a large clear plastic bag full of blankets onto the plane and put them into a closet in first class! I'd just left Disney World and the contrast of the Disney quality of service versus United's was stark. I began to wonder if the safety and evacuation training for United employees is better than their customer service training otherwise you better hope you never need them!"
10697,Southwest Airlines,31-Oct-11,Indonesia,10,Economy,5,YES,"YYC-IAH-MUC in Y. As an Aeroplan Elite I got premier access check in and boarding which was greatly appreciated. I also like that United seems to be making an effort to control oversized carry-ons. As a result both flights even the full flight to Munich left with all bags in the cabin. Planes were comfortable and clean (A320 and 764) with adequate room for my 5'8"" self. Crews were generally fantastic a real surprise given United's reputation. I like United's boarding structure as it prevents a mad dash to board and worked very well making boarding easy and comfortable. Only gripe is food on 10 hour IAH-MUC flight- small dinner and then before landing a mini croissant and small fruit cup- This is what I usually get on YYZ-MUC but that is a 7 hour flight. I expected more on this longer route and can imagine that some larger passengers were quite hungry! Connection in IAH was also very easy no security screening required no bus or train either even though I had to change terminals. Very impressed!"
10698,American Airlines,21-Jun-14,UK,9,Economy,4,NO,What a shame a wonderful Airline like Air New Zealand code shares with United Airlines. After a wonderful flight with Air New Zealand from Australia we then flew business with United within the United States. The 6 hour flight between New York and Los Angeles was a nightmare. From the small old plane to the noise from where the stewards were working( they couldn't help the noise as the work area is so small). Not to mention the very small unclean toilet. None of United earphones seem to work (I now know why most people on the flight had their own). The whole flight was a nightmare. I will never fly United again or recommend them.
10699,American Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,1,NO,"Our connection in San Francisco got cancelled due to aircraft maintenance. This was in the very early morning so there were no additional flights available for 5+ hours. After some research of the flight number that got cancelled this flight had been cancelled 2 additional times in the previous 3 weeks. That's one cancellation per week for this one aircraft. After we made it from San Francisco to LA for our re-route the LA flight was delayed an hour due to late aircraft arrival. Once we boarded we waited on the plane for 1 hour after everyone was boarded and settled in. Pilot originally said it was due to weather and admitted it was due to ""paper-work"" before takeoff. Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also. We were offered $7 each for food at the airport we had to wait at but that's it. I know a friend who had two flights cancelled in the same night due to airline problems. As a MileagePlus cardholder much more is expected. When we tried to get upgraded on our re-routed flights the guy said ""Oh this is a mileage flight"". This is the worst American airline aside from Spirit Airlines. Fly JetBlue or Virgin America if possible."
10700,American Airlines,21-Jun-14,UK,10,Economy,5,YES,I'm satisfied with my first couple of flights with United May-June 2014. I flew transatlantic EWR-Zurich and LHR T2-EWR I tried outbound on a premium plus seat for 125$ add on pretty comfortable. I'm only disappointed because I did not receive my special meal as requested the air hostess asked me to confirm with United's customer service centre next time. Otherwise arrived on time clean comfortable although too cold cabin. Good entertainment. I'm giving United also a good satisfaction rate because of 100% mileage earned on my loyalty program of another Star Alliance member.
10701,American Airlines,18-Jun-14,UK,7,Economy,5,YES,I was surprised at such a pleasant experience. We flew two US internal flights. The first was on time the second twenty mins late due to a minor technical fault. We were impressed with the monitors in the gate area showing available seating on the aircraft and probable departure time. We had no problem with carry on baggage. On the first flight people who had not checked in bigger bags were given labels and picked up their bags when they got off the plane. Plane was clean staff friendly coffee OK and the seat comfort was OK. No complaints - and I have to say I have suffered a lot worse.
10702,American Airlines,14-Jun-14,UK,9,Economy,2,YES,AMS-ORD 11 Jul. I had a most wonderful flight on United from Amsterdam to Chicago. The flight attendants were warm and made the experience one to remember. The flight departed and arrived on time. The new business class seats are great though I did not try the lie-flat option. I was in the pair next to the galley - fair warning the freezer compartment is next to the aisle seat and does make noise - need to wear your headphones. Food was great - had Thai chicken for main. However to repeat it was the flight attendants that made this flight one of the best I have experienced.
10703,American Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,2,NO,This has been the worst travel experience I have had. My original flight was cancelled I was not informed of this until I arrived at the airport. This should be standard protocol to notify passengers that the flight is cancelled. On top of that the customer service is atrocious. As I was reasonably upset and asking customer service to find me another flight she tells me that the next flight to my destination is boarding now but you cannot get on it. They put me on a connecting flight to Chicago 4 hours later. 4 hours later all Chicago flights were delayed another 2 hours. Meanwhile flights are boarding all around me. I strongly advise you to stay as far away as possible from United.
10704,American Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,1,NO,"Leaving Newark yesterday the gate agent announced that ""all overhead bin room was full"" as boarding group 4 (out of 5) was beginning to board. They forced gate check of all carry-on bags for all the remaining passengers. On boarding there were tons of open overhead bins with room remaining including one right at my seat! Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead. United has adopted a new policy and attitude about baggage that is Draconian - they should be ashamed. I will not fly United even though they have the only non-stop flights to my most frequent destination."
10705,American Airlines,13-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,2,NO,Quebec City to Newark on a regional jet. When I checked in at the airport I was told the flight was delayed 2.5 hours due to Newark traffic problems. There is no Star Alliance lounge at the airport. Listening to podcasts on my computer I heard a boarding call after only a one hour delay. After boarding the plane the captain said he was expected a smooth flight. The fasten seatbelt sign was never turned off during the smooth flight which makes one wonder if they ever turn off the fasten seatbelt sign on this flight. Customs and Immigration were done in Newark unlike other Canadian airports.
10706,American Airlines,13-Jun-14,UK,9,Economy,2,YES,TXL-EWR-LAX in Y. Had wanted to take the 757 flight from Berlin to Newark since the route was opened up by Continental. Since the merger between the two airlines is far from complete I knew the crew would all be Continental and knowing how poorly the new United is perceived not just by customers but staff too the old- fashioned Continental Airlines flight bag I hauled out of the back of my closet scored me a glass of champagne as I passed through the forward galley en route to my economy seat. Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is �cramped� or �claustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful. The second leg to California was quite decent enjoyed a chicken-and-blue- cheese wrap for sale and the view of the North American continent unfolding beneath our wing. Arrival into LAX was on-time and baggage delivery was prompt. No complaints � this time.
10707,American Airlines,10-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,1,YES,I read the reviews of this airline and was terrified. However we flew San Antonio to Dulles and Dulles to Boston and we were impressed. OK so the leg room is not fantastic but its better than many. The plane was reasonably clean the staff friendly and the coffee drinkable. Furthermore the flight to Dulles was on time. The Boston one left about 20 mins late due to an error light re the toilet showing in the cockpit but again the plane was clean and the staff friendly and efficient. No complaints.
10708,American Airlines,9-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,5,NO,My family and I flew United to Mexico for a wedding. We were scheduled to return to the United States on Monday 5/9/2014. Our scheduled flight was delayed 3.5 hours due to weather in Texas. This was understandable. The rest of this journey was not. In Mexico we were switched from our connecting flight due to the scheduled departure time. The flight we were switched to departed prior to our arrival at the Houston Airport. My family along with several others in our same situation then attempted to obtain another flight. The United personnel at the Houston Airport were very rude and not at all helpful. We spent over 16 hours in the airport with no blankets pillows or cots. I will never again fly United. The delays were one thing but the attitude of the employees was completely unacceptable.
10709,American Airlines,9-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,1,NO,F class KOA-LAX. A warm crew was the bright spot in an extremely inferior product. Small tray with all courses at the same time followed by a cookie in a paper bag. For a 5 hour flight this is ridiculous. Hawaii routes are served with the oldest run down aircraft. Leg room is adequate but entertainment option is pathetic. For first class Hawaiian is the only way to go. United is just sad.
10710,American Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,5,YES,UA1284 EWR-SFO 14 May 2014. No IFE or WiFi on a transcon? That's what I found when flying on brand new 737-900.� I've flown UA's older -900s and they have DirecTV-okay you have to pay for it but it's still better than nothing.�The flight itself was pleasant the new seats reasonably comfortable. One thing I've always liked about UA is that at least one flight attendant comes out every 30 minutes or so and has cups of water or the beverage cart coming around. But no entertainment? I could have flown Southwest they don't claim to have IFE on their flights.
10711,American Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,1,NO,The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.
10712,American Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,3,NO,Washington Dulles to San Diego Intl Airport. Flight UA1512. October 25th 2013. The worst experience I have had with ground staff - unhelpful difficult to reach. Flight OK but I would not recommend this airline to anyone and I certainly will not fly UA again.
10713,American Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,5,NO,LHR-IAH-CUN-IAH-LHR. Flew United Airlines they upgraded me to Economy Plus for free due to my disability. I enjoyed my flight. Staff really helpful. Food was alright.
10714,American Airlines,5-Jun-14,USA,2,Economy,2,NO,First flight was cancelled never got any notification that our flight was rescheduled for the following day. Got to the airport they representatives re re-routing the flights were not nice at all. I couldn't believe that there was no discount or free bag check offered. I will never fly united again worst customer service. We were suppose to be in Vegas by 3pm that day. We did not arrive until 3am the next day.
10715,American Airlines,3-Jun-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,This was my first and hopefully last time on a US airline. The short 45 minute flight from Dubai to Doha was an ordeal. Draconian security for this flight only terrible old plane unkempt rude flight staff a 2 hour delay with no apologies. Some Americans might rate United Airlines highly maybe because they are used to the generally low quality of most if not all airlines in the United States but for someone used to the superior services of Qatar Emirates Etihad etc this proved to be a really bad experience.
10716,American Airlines,2-Jun-14,USA,4,Economy,1,YES,ORD-DCA and BWI-ORD. Overall the experience was very good. All flights departed and arrived on time and all employees were friendly. The trip was through a tour so the price or value cannot be determined. Security on Monday at O'Hare was very crowded so be sure to allot enough time. Boarding was organized and most bags were checked at the gate because the overhead bins would have been to crowded. The seats on board were very comfortable and recline was decent. The plane was an A319 that has not been reconfigured with the slimline seating. Crew was very nice and efficient and Inwas given an entire can of apple juice. We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others. The flight arrived on time and bags were quick to come out of the carousel. United seems like they are beginning to overcome merger issues now.
10717,American Airlines,2-Jun-14,USA,7,Economy,3,YES,"April 26 FLL-CLE. My friend flew with miles and I flew for $400. Not bad considering that it was booked 3 weeks in advance and during a popular travel time. Check in crew and gate agents at FLL are outstanding. So friendly and willing to help out. The check in crew were smiling and friendly and helped out with checked bag issue. The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL. We didn't hear the captain inform us about it or speak once during the flight. The flight was completely full. The flight was on a A320 with the new slimline seats. The legroom was adequate for my height of 5' 10"" however the seat was very hard and didn't recline very far. I purchased the wifi and for $5 was a great deal. No music or overhead screens on this plane. Connection through Cleveland was very easy and the airport was very easy to connect through. Flight from CLE to ORD was 60% full and had another great crew. They were very enthusiastic. The flight was operated by a 737-700 with very comfortable seats. Not one person on board purchased the over priced direct TV. Flight arrived on time bags quickly arrived at carousel. Overall United was decent. A bit overpriced but was on time with friendly service."
10718,American Airlines,2-Jun-14,Australia,10,Economy,3,NO,LHR-EWR and back. You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.
10719,American Airlines,2-Jun-14,USA,9,Economy,4,YES,Newark to London Heathrow 4 June. Found them ok in all areas. Plane very clean drinks brought around regularly. Seat comfortable with plenty of legroom.
10720,American Airlines,30-May-14,USA,10,Economy,1,NO,Horrible experience. I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai. The plane was a tired creaky old B-777. Flight attendants whose average age was nearly 60 were grumpy and rude. Only a stale bagel was served. Definitely one of the worst flight experiences I had ever to endure.
10721,American Airlines,30-May-14,UK,10,Economy,5,NO,BOS and MCI and again from BOS to YYT. Overall a below average - average airline. Gate staff and flight attendants can be surly but occasionally a helpful and attentive one can be found. I generally will not fly United unless they are significantly cheaper or have markedly better connections/flight times than everyone else.
10722,American Airlines,29-May-14,UK,0,Economy,2,NO,LAX to Quebec City Canada. May 22 and 28 2014: What a nightmare full of delays and lack of updated information so I a 77 year old grandmother had to run from one end of an airport to the other to catch a plane sat in airports for many wasted precious travel hours. The movies on board were horrible choices. I hope to never need to fly United again in my life. And I have done a LOT of traveling.
10723,American Airlines,28-May-14,UK,0,Economy,5,YES,We travelled to NY 28/5/14 with United Airlines and from the minute we went to check in desk we where treated with courtesy. The staff were both friendly and helpful. Once on the plane we again had the same experience. The food was ok and served hot. The choice of films etc was great and to have the chance to charge your devices was very handy. On our return we were due to fly with a different airline but we missed our flights. The other airline couldn't care less and said we would need to pay $1300 each to get home. We decided to go over to the United desk to see if they could offer any help. They went above and beyond to help us get on another flight with a different company for no charge.
10724,American Airlines,27-May-14,Italy,0,Economy,4,NO,"May 21 Denver to Los Angeles: The A320 was having mechanical problems which delayed departure by over an hour. Meantime a violent thunderstorm/tornado warning further delayed departure until we were 2.5 hours late leaving. Needless to say our connection to Hilo HI was way gone before we arrived. We were bumped from one customer service desk to another. The line at Gate 71 never moved for an hour. Children were tired and screaming while the customer service reps mumbled useless statements waited for phone returns and after an hour declared we had no hotel or meal compensation because DIA coded the departure as late due to ""weather"". If the plane had been ready at departure time there would have been no delay. The rude and helpless reception at Los Angeles resulted in several of us sleeping in the airport all night missing a full day of reserved vacation time a change in destination from Hilo to Kona a change in car rental arrangements and a long drive around the island instead of 30 miles as originally planned. The scene at the customer service desk was hellish and I was prepared to see any one of the passengers leap across the counter at the inept and uncaring mumbling representatives. I will never travel on United again."
10725,American Airlines,26-May-14,USA,10,Economy,2,NO,June 3 EWR-SFO Economy on a new 737-900. We departed two hours late due to a storm and flight crew distributed water and was generally helpful and good humored. These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight. These planes may be perfect for a 1-2 hour trip but not for a transcontinental journey.
10726,American Airlines,26-May-14,South Africa,3,Economy,1,NO,London LHR - Newark EWR. Boeing 757-200 quite old and it was visible everywhere as cabin looked shabby. Cabin crew ok but limited their service to distributing food collecting trays and that's it. Small portions paid alcoholic drinks torn inflight magazine. Nothing special there are much better options on this route.
10727,American Airlines,25-May-14,USA,5,Economy,1,YES,We flew UA893 SFO to ICN on B747 on 29th May 2014. Flight was delayed 2 times - captain rejected the first plane due to technical issue and the replaced plane returned to gate after found technical glitch while taxiing. Overall almost 5 hours delay. The captain tried his best to kept us updated on the delays. Instruction of allowing passengers to leave the plane during the delay was not clear resulted in passenger wandering around the bridge area. Cabin crew changed after the 2nd delay which turned out to be a plus point to us. Original crew serving the upper deck was grumpy the replacement crew (original crew gone probably due to extended hour) was fantastic provided one of the better quality service to a almost fully filled business class cabin. The plane was old and there was sign of dirt especially around the edges of the window frame. Seat itself was comfortable. It is weird to see UA cramping 2-4-2 seat in business class. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment was average. For the price paid UA has exceeded our expectation.
10728,American Airlines,21-May-14,Canada,2,Economy,1,YES,ORD to LHR in a fully refurbished 767-300ER. Efficient and helpful check in. Nice lounge was very busy but had nice atmosphere and nice bar tenders. Boarding efficient. Very good seating notwithstanding 6 abreast and good cabin ambience. Some pairs of seats are backwards facing but not a big issue. Professional and helpful crew who were well organised attentive and efficient - a real surprise. Very good choice of wines and OK food but nice desert and very good cheese plate. Seat in sleeping position was good and nice large pillow. Big screen noise reduction earphones and OK programming with mostly American content. Many language options. Luggage return quick. Overall very impressed and would consider better than transatlantic AC and LH flights taken in previous 3 weeks.
10729,American Airlines,21-May-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Six hour delay from San Antonio to Houston. I could have driven there and back. The flight crew and gate staff were so rude! No recompense whatsoever. Not even an apology to the over two hundred passengers. My first time to fly with United and my last.
10730,American Airlines,21-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,1st class UA 926 LHR-EWR in 3 cabin 767. Check in with Biz class pax long line. Indifferent contract staff were clueless regarding arrival facilities at EWR. Ditto for gate agents. Flight attendant told me to check with transfer desk at EWR after clearing customs. Transfer agent told me that there were no arrival facilities unless continuing on with UA. Huh at a UA hub for 1st class? I noticed that meal served in 1st was the same as in Biz albeit with better china. Altogether a thoroughly mediocre experience for a huge premium price. There are many better ways to cross the pond - especially those of us needing to freshen up for post arrival meetings.
10731,American Airlines,20-May-14,Canada,8,Economy,1,NO,ORD-AMS on a clapped out Boeing 767 which showed its age. The worst experience on this flight were the cabin crew. The most unfriendly lazy rude and uninterested crew I have ever flown with. Shouting at passengers to close the overhead lockers refusing to close these themselves. This is one of their safety duties! The service was slow no peanuts/snacks with the drinks. Dinner was awful cold by the time I was served and totally inadequate for a 7 hr flight. Beer/wine are for sale only and when I asked for a soft drink they offered water only! A second request for a soft drink was rudely refused. Inflight entertainment was terrible small screens and all channels started without any announcement so by the time you wanted to watch anything films were already running for 30 mins. I am a Star alliance Gold member and have flown more than most people but this flight was by far the worst I have ever experienced. No more United for me!
10732,American Airlines,19-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,I booked a 5 day weekend from Thursday to Tuesday. My flight was cancelled while I was on my way to the Airport. I had to pay for a taxi to and from the airport and return the next day at 4am for a 6am flight. My original flight was a 2 hour direct flight from Newark to Atlanta but the rescheduled flight had a layover in Chicago. I arrived in Atlanta at 12pm. I could have leave with that but I could not believe that my return flight was cancelled and this time without a notice. I only found out because I couldn't print my boarding pass. I was rescheduled on a flight to LaGuardia and because the agent did not completed the booking I missed the flight and had to be put on another flight 3 hours later. I got to the airport at 5.45pm and did not take off until 10.53pm for a 2 hour flight. I am still waiting for an explanation for cancelling both flights.
10733,American Airlines,17-May-14,USA,9,Economy,1,YES,Louisville - Houston - Denver - Reno. All flights on time. Plenty of drink runs on all flights. Snack boxes for purchase but I did not try any. All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno. Everything went like clockwork so no complaints and my luggage arrived safely minus the slipper I had to take out in Louisville.
10734,American Airlines,17-May-14,Canada,8,Business,4,NO,May 17th from Toronto to Cancun with a connection in Houston. The plane had a mechanical problem half way to Houston and had to land in Memphis. More than 100 people were asked to stay at Memphis airport and wait for another plane to come. We waited for 7 hours from 1.30 to 8.30. The airport staff first said that the plane would come at 7.30 and later announced that it would be one hour late. All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do. In the end it took them 3 hours to get everyone arranged. Up to this point I am totally disappointed with United Airline. I'd rather pay a little more to get a better service. This is my first time flying with United and shall be the last.
10735,American Airlines,16-May-14,UK,10,Economy,2,NO,"Long story short they kept finding reasons to delay and cancel my flights and those of the people around me. It was chaos and passengers all around were complaining of their own horror stories with United. I spent the night in a Chicago airport (admittedly a large part of my nightmare was O'Hare airport) and no one who worked there for United seemed to care that I needed a flight out because they were so overwhelmed with the number of flights that were canceled and people that needed to be rebooked. They didn't give me a hotel room because the problem was due to ""weather "" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again. It was like it was normal for them to have upset customers and the people like me who didn't give them a hard time were more likely to messed about."
10736,American Airlines,16-May-14,USA,9,Economy,1,YES,IAH to YYC on Boeing 737-800. Smooth check-in. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft decent seat and legroom. Pro-active crew and multiple offerings of beverages. Bags on baggage belt by the time I arrived there.
10737,American Airlines,16-May-14,USA,9,Economy,2,NO,BOS-IAH. I was traveling with my family for holiday from BOS-LAX via IAH. My son is severely allergic to nuts and we always carry Epipen with us. We informed United customer service agent in advance about the allergy they made a note in system and advised us to inform the crew on board. When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement. After take off they did announce in so low volume that no one really could hear anything. More than 3 million people in the United States report being allergic to peanuts tree nuts or both. I would like to warn those people in advance about the United Nut Policy.
10738,American Airlines,16-May-14,USA,5,Economy,5,YES,EWR-PVG on a 777-200. Economy Plus exit window seat. Was able to get this seat without paying for it due to a bug in the online seat map (otherwise it would be an extra $192). Overall it was a satisfying flight given I only paid a little above 600 dollars for this non-stop flight which would usually be over 900. The food was standard but not very adequate. There were friendly flight attendants but some were very rude and indifferent. Entertainment was ok but the system was sluggish. The headset did not work but I was able to use my own earphones. Lavatories were not very well maintained and I didn't see any flight attendant clean it during the entire flight. However all these negative aspects were overpowered by the price and the free exit window seat. Would definitely fly them again.
10739,American Airlines,14-May-14,USA,9,Economy,1,NO,All week long flying with our three year old we have preboarded the planes. Well upon boarding a flight that need I say arrived two hours late with United we were told to get in the back of the line with her as they have voided the children board first policy as of this weekend. He was rude about telling us and made it embarrassing as if we were doing something so wrong we were doing what we are used to doing not to mention we didn't just try to be the very first we actually got in line up 2 just because we weren't in any hurry to board. After all we all leave at the same time right? After waiting almost 4 hours at the airport with a toddler because of a delayed flight that's not how to really brighten someone's day and treat them. Maybe if you want to change a policy like that again and be butts about it at the gate be sure everyone is aware of your new stupid rule!
10740,American Airlines,14-May-14,USA,10,Economy,1,NO,"After having a confirmed reservation to Buenos Aires in first class for three months before the flight for which I used miles - I'm a million mile plus flyer - I was bumped from first class and sent back to row 30 (on a 767) because United had oversold the flight and other passengers had paid more money for their tickets (not used miles). The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have. A deal should be a deal or the airline should warn people in advance that their accumulated miles which they tout as being very valuable are really not so valuable and can become worthless if the airline chooses. When I complained after the flight United's response was essentially ""too bad""."
10741,American Airlines,14-May-14,Finland,7,Economy,5,NO,This experience has been disgusting. I was flying from Newark NJ to London to grab a connecting flight to get to Dublin. The original flight was delayed 3 hours which wouldn't be so bad if someone would have properly advised us about the following connection. Due to the total lack of communication I proceeded to miss my connecting flight because United failed to give me the information I needed to make it on time. I will never fly with this airline again.
10742,American Airlines,12-May-14,Dominican Republic,8,Economy,1,NO,"Flew out of SFO an hour and a half late. Got to Houston only to find out my flight to Huntsville had been cancelled. I go to the ""customer service"" desk to be put on another flight. The only one she says is available is the 4 o clock flight the next day but I can get on standby for the 10:30 am flight. I ask her if I'll get reimbursed for the hotel room I'll have to get. She says United doesn't reimburse for weather and then tells me I won't be able to find a hotel room because there is a conference in Houston and there are no hotel rooms available but I can sleep in the airport. She also complains to me that everyone is taking it out on them and it's not fair. I proceed to tell her it's also not fair that my flight was cancelled and that they won't reimburse me for a hotel room or food or taxi fare. When I went back through security I was told I was not able to re-enter the airport because my flight wasn't until the next day. I ended up finding a hotel room and thanks to my mom calling travelocity I got on the 1030am flight. I ended up cancelling my flight back to SFO on United and booked it with American."
10743,American Airlines,12-May-14,UK,10,Economy,1,NO,I really was disappointed. Leaving Milwaukee no flight crew. One and a half hours late leaving stand in line for two hours to get connecting flight changed airplane waiting for me to board. This was leaving Milwaukee for Houston. Coming home leave Florida great. Get to Chicago no crew finally board plane wrong crew and asked us to get off the plane. Wait for right crew to get there held up in Milwaukee. Get on plane 1.5 hours late taxi back to terminal plane over heating. Get this fixed so we have no air conditioning in plane sweat and over heat to go to Milwaukee. What is the problem. Don't think I ever want to fly United again if this is the normal procedure.
10744,American Airlines,12-May-14,UK,10,Economy,1,NO,"Seattle-San Francisco/San Francisco-Sydney-Perth. The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in ""row 5"" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one. This delayed departure by 15 minutes due to the incompetent staff at boarding gate not listening to where we were going. San Francisco to Sydney was poor service poor food no drinks unless you purchased them. Qantas flight Sydney to Perth only a 4 hour flight and free drinks with meal and the offer of second one ."
10745,American Airlines,11-May-14,UK,10,Economy,4,YES,"Rome to Newark (EWR) in Business First departing at 9:50 a.m. We were lucky that we could use the miles we had accrued with the United Mileage Plus card for this trip and were very happy with the flight. United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane. All in all a great flight."
10746,American Airlines,9-May-14,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,Flew a 747-400 from Chicago to Hong Kong. The economy seats were horrible. They were extremely small. The seats were so bad I stood for over 5 hours during the flight.
10747,American Airlines,9-May-14,UK,4,Economy,1,YES,Flew YEG to Amsterdam through Houston return in business first. Flight crew on all flights were great very professional and hard working. The one complaint was the food Tasteless overcook and very little variety. Also cabin could be kept a little tidier. Other than that good flights.
10748,American Airlines,9-May-14,USA,10,Economy,1,YES,"IAH-SFO on A319 and SFO-IAH on B787. Comparing the 2 legs with 2 different aircraft is hard. I would look forward to more planes look like the Dreamliner in regards to age and cleanness. I have no complaints but just general concerns. Economy Plus is just the more legroom nothing more nothing less. It's the small things that can add up a pillow here and tiny bag of peanuts there and lets say a complementary cocktail on longer flights in Eco Plus to stand up to the ""Premium Eco Class"" and to be ""Eco Plus friendly. I miss the work hard-fly right slogan."
10749,American Airlines,9-May-14,USA,10,Economy,2,YES,Boeing 777 SYD-LAX LAX-SFO SFO-SYD. Service was professional Food surprisingly good. IFE very good. Boeing 777 legroom is good. I'm not crazy on these new economy seats on United when the seat recline the seat base moves forward. This is not good for the back and make sleeping less comfortable. Altogether very good experience plus receiving 100% miles even though the ticket was discounted.
10750,American Airlines,7-May-14,USA,0,Economy,2,NO,Completely unreasonable and unwilling to help customers. Do not take United if you want any kind of decent customer service friendliness of staff or bearable trip. The woman behind the counter at check in seemed to feel a need to give me attitude for no apparent reason. Even at a small airport like in Ithaca NY United was unable to accommodate me.
10751,American Airlines,7-May-14,France,10,Economy,4,NO,Had to fly United as it was the only one flying in at out at the times I needed. Flight from DEN-YXE was delayed twice on the way out. Then flying from YXE-DEN we sat in a small hot plane sweating for over an 1.5 hours after landing because Customs wasn't open for business yet and we weren't allowed off the plane. It is a daily flight so they should know when customs opens? Transfer from DEN-EUG had no gate until 2 hours prior which changed 2 times missed the flight because the last change was 20 minutes prior. Next flight out was 10 hours later. Unless you are person that likes sitting in Airports for days and enjoys wasting time and money this airline is an extreme last resort!
10752,American Airlines,6-May-14,UK,10,Economy,4,NO,Would never fly with United Airlines again we boarded the plane back from Florida to Newark to fly on to the UK to be greeted by miserable crew. This continued the whole of the flight. Anything asked of them seemed too much trouble food was awful and was practically thrown at us. Seating was so uncomfortable cramped together but the worst part was as we were coming into land at Newark the pilot overshot the runway had to pull back up very fast and circle to try again it all happened so fast - it was so scary but not one of the crew checked on any of us passengers one lady got up to be sick in the toilet - all we had was a female cabin crew shouting for her to get out of the toilet and sit down. A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were. Wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone and will never fly with them again.
10753,American Airlines,5-May-14,Australia,3,Economy,1,NO,MKE-ORD-SFO and back. The first flight was delayed so we missed connection. Our connection was supposed to be a nice 777 but we missed it. Thankfully they said our flight was delayed because of maintenance problems so they gave a hotel and food vouchers. Slept at a nice hotel at ORD. Because of the low price for they tried to put us on a non direct fight for Washington and then to SFO. We finally got scheduled for a flight at 8:30. the airplane was okay. It was an old 757-200 with no entertainment systems or stuff. When we arrived at SFO it was midday and we still had time to explore the city.
10754,American Airlines,4-May-14,Mexico,10,Economy,5,NO,San Diego to Moline via Chicago O'Hare. When we landed in Chicago I received a text message from United Airlines that our connecting flight was canceled. They rescheduled us for 14 hours later! We live 2 1/2 hours away so we rented a car and drove. Our reimbursement was 1/4 the cost didn't even cover the car rental. No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way. I will never book a flight with United Airlines again.
10755,American Airlines,29-Apr-14,UK,10,Economy,3,NO,This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off. I also just found out that my flight will be delayed again. I now understand why United is suffering; their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I don't recommend ever flying with this company. Rates are reasonable but it is most certainly not worth the hassle.
10756,American Airlines,29-Apr-14,Venezuela,5,Economy,4,YES,Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.
10757,American Airlines,29-Apr-14,USA,10,Economy,5,YES,Reno-Denver-Chicago-Louisville. All flights on time. Late check-in at Reno (my fault) and the ground staff helped to rush me through and make the flight all with a positive attitude and was greeted upon boarding the plane. Each flight was about 85% full so not packed in. Leg room was just fine on the A320 B757 and EMB175. All attendants pleasant with just enough drink runs on each flight. All beverages were free including spirits. This was in economy! Arrived on time in Louisville more than happy with my day flying across country on three different flights. Plus my luggage made it. Maybe I am just lucky but United always seems to work out great for me. Used my air miles so this round trip only cost me $10.
10758,American Airlines,28-Apr-14,USA,8,Economy,5,NO,United airline is a terrible airline for overseas travels. I flew Chicago to Frankfort. Crew were rude and unhelpful. Somebody was seating in my seat and crew didn't support me when I asked her to go back to her seat. I reserved a seat at the time of booking and they sold me the same seat for extra $100! In a 12 hr flight there is no free alcoholic beverage no socks toothbrush or toothpaste. I strongly recommend never fly with united especially for overseas.
10759,American Airlines,25-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,5,YES,IAD-SFO and SFO-IAD Flew United non-stop in economy. Absolutely no complaints. The planes were clean on time and the flight attendants were very good - always working. We brought our own food on board so cannot comment on the food sold. On the SFO-IAD flight there was quite a bit of turbulence but the pilot handled it very well. All of the United employees we encountered in the air and on the ground were friendly helpful and seemed to be happy in their jobs.
10760,American Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,8,Business,1,NO,I wish I would have read the reviews for United before letting the travel agency book me on one of their flights. Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question. After standing in the customer service line to re-book I was told no flights for two days. The customer service lady did seem to care and spent half an hour looking for alternatives. I heard all sorts of people complaining about this airline and our shuttle driver said she hears about them all the time.
10761,American Airlines,23-Apr-14,UK,9,Business,4,NO,Recently flew several long international flights with United from Chicago to Tokyo and back. For a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment no seatback TV and they not charge money for drinks. I would argue that United is well below the average. The flight attendants do the bare minimum and nothing more. I will not fly on United again.
10762,American Airlines,23-Apr-14,Australia,1,Economy,4,NO,EWR-ZRH. Traveled with baby staff very inattentive and almost ignored our requests even as simple as asking for some water (to make baby food). When water was brought this was done with no empathy and not asking if there was something else they could do. Any question was first met by unfriendly looks. United's ground service at EWR was a catastrophe. There are electronic check-in counters about 20 with max. 3 staff to put the luggage onto the conveyor belt or to help if something can't be done through the user's interface the computer tells you to 'wait for staff to help you' we waited for more than 20 minutes.
10763,American Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,4,First Class,1,YES,We flew to Puerto Vallarta and back with a connection in Houston. Believe it or not flying United we actually had a fairly decent experience. Yes the seats in coach are tight and uncomfortable. But at least 2 of the 4 flights left on time. Both flights to PV were on time and landed a bit ahead of schedule. We weren't so lucky on our return flights. The flight out of PV was delayed about a half hour because our plane arrived late. The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK. Other then a few of their complimentary drinks that's all we had on the plane. We refuse to pay for airline food. Not once on any flight did either my wife or myself use the bathroom. So to some it up even though I hate to fly this experience wasn't that bad.
10764,American Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,It seems to have become the norm for United Express to not announce any delays until everyone is checked in. Then the announcements come every half hour increasing the wait time. Our flight from Halifax to Newark was to depart at 1.10 pm and eventually left after 5pm. Our return flight was to leave at 8.38 pm and left after midnight. Never ever again.
10765,American Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,5,NO,My husband and I recently returned from a trip using United Airlines. We arrived at our international destination 12 hours later than the original arrival time. Since that was mainly due to weather I can't blame United. On the way home though we had a terrible experience. Our final flight from Houston to Fayetteville was supposed to board at 6.45pm but they kept delaying it around every half hour until finally at midnight they canceled the flight entirely. There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason. Upon reaching Tulsa we discovered our luggage had been separated and my bag was sent to our original destination while my husband's stayed back in Houston airport. We had to drive to Fayetteville airport to pick up my bag. The next day we had to drive back to Fayetteville to pick up my husband's bag. Definitely the last time we will ever fly with United.
10766,American Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,Flew to Chicago on Friday flight was delayed 6 hours. When it came time to return home I received an email that my flight was cancelled. I talked to a United rep she told me an identical flight was leaving at the same time as my cancelled flight so she would book me on that one. Turns out she misinformed me there was no such flight. I got to the airport found out she had booked me for a flight the following day so I had to rebook yet again. On my return flight the plane was delayed 2 hours. We all get on the plane and after taxi-ing for 45 minutes we received an announcement that we were going back to the gate. I had to spend the night in the airport. I will never fly United again.
10767,American Airlines,22-Apr-14,France,1,Economy,4,NO,My husband booked our flight out of Gulfport MS to Las Vegas. The price was good but we were not allowed enough time between connecting flights. My husband is in a wheelchair and I appreciate the skycaps who managed to get us to the connecting flights although it almost killed me at 65 to have to get through the airport with our luggage. The biggest mishap was that when we arrived in Los Angeles from Las Vegas we were told there was no room for our carry on luggage so it was checked. My husband's bag went to Hawaii. After many days of talking to people on the phone who obviously have a problem understanding English we finally got his bag delivered. Flying United was very stressful for me and I would be very hesitant to fly United again. I think they need to do a better job of informing their customers of what to expect.
10768,American Airlines,22-Apr-14,UK,10,Economy,5,NO,"Plane was supposed to take off at 1pm delayed to 3pm then finally to 7pm with no guarantee of no further delay. Now I am stuck in LAX waiting. All I got for the trouble caused by United Airline is a sorry from the representative and a $7 meal voucher - very good customer care indeed. Request to adjust seat told the plane is 100% full. Okay so I request to adjust seat in advance for my return flight now this is where it gets interesting: I was told by the desk representative that their ""system"" will not let her do so and was advised to use United Airline website to adjust seat myself the only problem is their website does not have the seat change option either. Overall I would not recommend anyone to take United Airline for their poor system setup and bad customer care."
10769,American Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,EWR-IND think United is canceling more flights than they are operating. If not canceled flights are most of the time significantly delayed. Ground staff are unfriendly and not willing to help. This is not an experience just on this flight it seems to be always like that. Comfort and service in the aircraft is lousy. Will try not to go with United in the future.
10770,American Airlines,18-Apr-14,UK,6,Economy,1,YES,Traveled CLE-SFO-NRT-MNL March 15th returned May 7th. Business class. Booked this reluctantly experience a year earlier was not so great on the SFO-NRT leg. In cabin service and food was terrible. This year was a world different. All flights on time or early food was good inflight service was very good the inflight entertainment worked great check in was very friendly and attentive. The final leg is serviced by ANA. Last year the difference between UA and ANA was dramatic. This year practically seamless. The only change this year was that we were on the upper deck this time. We were amazed at the transformation in a year's time. Younger attentive flight attendants friendly service and all worked as planned. Great transformation!
10771,American Airlines,17-Apr-14,UK,5,Economy,5,NO,Do not pay the extra cost for the comfort seats. That is the biggest scam that this airline has going. I have paid for comfort seats on KLM and WestJet and they were so worth it. This airline - expensive and the only thing you get is slightly more leg room. The same uncomfortable seat in all other ways. This airline has to have the worst service of all airlines in the G20 (sorry have not flown others). Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment. On a recent flight to Hawaii at least they had the courtesy of telling us not to bother because the inflight entertainment did not work over the ocean anyway. I love to read but 6 hours straight is quite a reading marathon. I will pay extra costs for a flight rather than fly United.
10772,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,3,Business,1,NO,As a seasoned traveler I am constantly reminded what a disgrace United Airlines is to the Star Alliance. I've just completed a Star Alliance Round The World Business First trip on Thai Lufthansa Air Canada Air New Zealand and unfortunately one sector on United. Despite being Gold Elite status and paying $US15 000 each for the fare United refused me entry to their lounge in MCO at 0615h - when it was almost totally empty. They seated my wife and I in 3B and 5F for the six hour flight to SFO despite being booked on the one ticket and pre- allocated 1A and 1B four months earlier! Are the traveling American public so accepting of sub-standard?
10773,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,9,Business,1,YES,26 April 2014 Verona-Monaco.�LH 434 26 April 2014 Monaco-Chicago. UA 8838 26 April 2014 Chicago-Madison. Superb Lufthansa service than you land in the USA and there is a long line at Passport control and no way to have an express service. I missed my connecting flight and what a surprise it was my fault and I had to pay for the hotel transport food etc.
10774,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Nothing but delays right from the start. We flew Vancouver to Chicago then to Ireland. Everyone had to check in themselves and weren't given seat numbers until boarding so no sitting next to your family. Staff weren't friendly. Flight was an hour late departing. No organization at all at the airport. Would not use them again.
10775,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,Australia,1,Economy,3,NO,My father and I had a reservation to fly from Boston to Sacramento. We had a connecting flight in Denver. Our flight leaving Boston was delayed 50 minutes our flight arrived in Denver at the exact time our connecting flight from Denver was leaving. United Airlines didn't hold the next plane just a few minutes and so 13 people on our plane missed the connecting flight. The next flight for Sacramento left the next morning so we went to customer service to have them reserve a hotel for us but they claimed that the error was not made by their airline and wouldn't pay for our hotel. Now we have to sit in an airport terminal all night. United Airlines is not a good airline and I won't be flying with them anymore.
10776,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Nightmare with United last week. I had a 1st class ticket Miami-Chicago on UA and Chicago-Zurich-Brussels on Swiss 3 flights on one ticket. Connecting time in Chicago 3 hours and 25 minutes. Checked-in in Miami for my UA flight and Y flight was delayed several times. Finally the plane landed. Ready for boarding and then technical failure was announced. Staff did not know if and when the plane would leave. I explained my situation and asked to be rebooked on another airline any airline in order to leave Miami since I was supposed to have a knee surgery upon my return in Brussels. UA staff refused and were not polite at all. Finally at 8pm announcement that our flight was cancelled. I had spent nearly 7 hours at that airport. I was granted a room at the Holiday Inn airport which was fine and then food vouchers at the same hotel. In total 21 USD for lunch/dinner/breakfast. One thing is for sure never again United. I was rebooked on the day after Miami/Newark/Brussels on the day after first class domestic business class long-haul. Ok but far from the Swiss service standards.
10777,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,7,Business,1,NO,Outward�journey on 30/3/2014 on flight UA 941 and inbound journey on 25/4/2014 on flight UA 17. We had a double cancellation of flights to and from LHR-EWR. Flight to LHR was cancelled but the reason remained unclear and the flight from EWR was cancelled after we were told there was a technical problem with the aircraft. Luckily they gave us hotel accommodation and taxi fares along with also breakfast and dinner vouchers. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. It caused lots of stress.
10778,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,3,YES,FRA-SFO on 747-400 this might have been a 9 or 10 star review except for the very late (over 30 minutes) delivery of bags at SFO with priority bags not apparently given any priority - service onboard was impeccable - staff were attentive and professional and did everything they could to make the long flight as comfortable as possible - UA really does need to start handing out pyjamas in F and could also make the bed softer as well as making the blankets thicker and wider if they really want passengers to get some good sleep. Food was OK nothing special - the mushroom soup in a very small cup was the best course while the beef was tough.
10779,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,Belgium,8,Economy,4,NO,I really don't know how to express my dissatisfaction with United. I buy business class and get dumped into economy. No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.
10780,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,Horrible service rude flight attendants check in process rude. The woman told us it was not her job to do the check-in for us when we had questions and the machine would not print or accept my credit card. We were left to our own devices and were just rudely told to hurry up as we were not the only customers there. Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate. After asking a couple of times we got our boarding passes just to be told during boarding our daughter could not be seated with us because we were sitting in an emergency exit and she had to sit 7 rows behind us. The cabin attendants were not very helpful and finally we got a nice couple to swap places with us.
10781,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,Canada,9,Premium,2,NO,April 27 2014 OKC to YYZ my connecting flight was in EWR. When I arrived at Newark I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. The reason for cancellation - bad weather in Toronto. I asked the staff member to find me a different flight the best he could come up with was a flight for the next day! I explained that this was unacceptable. I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada. What I want to know is how is the weather in Toronto can be a problem for United airlines but not a problem for every other airline in North America. I fly several times a year I will never fly with United Airlines again.
10782,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"I flew from BTV-EWR-DFW a few months ago and it was by far the worst experience. Outbound flight to EWR was delayed 1 hour 15 minutes. The connection in EWR was missed by about 3 minutes. The customer service agent was useless and also put the blame on myself for missing the connection. I waited about 5.5 hours in what has to have been the dingiest terminal in the US (Newark's C2 concourse) for the next flight to DFW which of course was delayed. Once boarded we sat at the gate for an additional 40 minutes without any communication from the crew. The pilot then informed us that ""it appears the people refuelling this thing put more in the right wing than they did in the left"". We waited yet another 20 minutes for him to come back and say ""to add insult to injury it appears that the APU is broken and it wouldn't be a good idea to fly without it."" An hour has passed since we boarded and we finally pushed back. The inflight service was sub-par and only one beverage service was offered during the 3.5 hour flight. Overall an appalling experience on an airline that used to be enjoyable. Also if you're not flying international or a hub to hub expect a regional jet or prop plane."
10783,United Airlines,21-Jun-14,Indonesia,9,Business,2,NO,We flew out to San Francisco on Delta on April 27 2014 - a great flight even though we had a longer trip because of storms. The flight waited on us constantly during the long flight. On May 1 2014 we flew home on United 1278. The two stewards and one stewardess were terrible! Went up and down twice during our flight back to Atlanta. I was in a window seat and hey never spoke to me! The pilot did a good job - but did not speak loud enough.
10784,United Airlines,19-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,4,NO,MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.
10785,United Airlines,19-Jun-14,USA,2,First Class,4,NO,Do not take United flight from Honolulu to Guam. The plane and configuration used is for domestic flights plus there is no inflight entertainment. I fly business first all the time with United. This flight was nearly 8 hours and it was like flying with a 3rd world airline. Food was terrible. An unbelievable experience for an airline that generally does very well.
10786,United Airlines,19-Jun-14,Taiwan,1,Economy,4,YES,Business class AMS-ORD-YVR. Check in went very smooth departure with 15 minutes delay due to air traffic control. I was seated in a window seat which was ok but if you want to get out of it you have to bother your neighbor. Flight attendants were quite old no youngsters like on flights with KLM. Food selection and service were good. Also the inflight entertainment was sufficient. With a small delay we landed at ORD. The flight to YVR was not special in business. Snack was below average and seat is medium. Overall satisfying and would do it again for the price.
10787,United Airlines,17-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,4,YES,Flew TLV-EWR-SFO and back flights were on time boarding was smooth crew were pleasant and friendly. Food standard airplane but served hot. Experience from flying with other airlines we came equipped with movies books on our tablets.
10788,United Airlines,17-Jun-14,Canada,1,Economy,5,NO,Flight from Fort Lauderdale to St Johns with connecting flight in Newark. Left Fort Lauderdale late ran to connecting flight with less than 15 mins to spare flight ended up 4 hours delayed but was never updated online or any departure board. Connecting flight Eventually cancelled because of fog in Newfoundland all though other family members arrived home on Air Canada and Westjet without the fog being an issue. They did give us a toiletry bag to take back to hotel we paid for. No apology but was put on a 6 am flight following morning. Terrible service and flights with no entertainment or compensation.
10789,United Airlines,17-Jun-14,Australia,5,Economy,1,NO,My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.
10790,United Airlines,17-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"LHR-EWR: sat on tarmac at LHR for 3 hours before being informed the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. United tried to re-book us on a flight 24 hours later and only after considerable effort did they find us seats on a (half empty) BA departure. EWR-HR: Flight was overbooked so without asking us we were ""upgraded"" to Ec. Plus. The net result of which was I lost my aisle seat for a middle. I would have preferred to stay in Ec but was not consulted before being moved. The check-in staff at both LHR and EWR are easily the rudest I have ever come across. Also United don't have on-demand entertainment (someone please tell them its 2014 not 2004) and the seats are uncomfortable and narrow. Unless there is a massive price premium please take my advice and fly with a different airline."
10791,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,Canada,1,Economy,4,NO,I recently booked a flight to Denver from Kansas City trip cost was $376 avoiding other airports I wanted a one way flight to and fro. Price went to $925. Then while boarding the flight we have a prop plane. The seats were so narrow and of course no air-conditioning. The flight took an exceptionally long time back and forth from Kansas to Denver. I don't understand the United Airline Magazine says how their improving the flight for the customer. I think its time the execs take a flight cause your badly mistaken.
10792,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,4,NO,March flights. We were a party of 6 and it was the first time flying United. We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight. Finally arrived in New Orleans 6 hours later than scheduled. Of course we weren't seated together. Return flight - one of our party didn't get a seat at all. Had to take a later flight and all that entails.
10793,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,5,YES,Just returned from USA. SYD-SFO-LV-NY-SFO-SYD. Overall very good experience - travelling with 3 others inc 2 Children. Upgraded both international legs to economy Plus - makes a world of difference. Staff on Board were very welcoming (not OTT but very professional). Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark. Anyway - proceeded back to Customer Service desk where a fantastic attendant was very helpful provided us with a comp at the Crown Plaza near Airport and gave us some comfort packs. With 777 aircraft replacing 747 ex Sydney United will get my business again (at the right price).
10794,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"After a 20 min delay during the first part of our trip we arrived in Charlotte only to be told we had to race across the entirety of the airport in less that 15 mins (which would have been feasible if we had the full 35+ mins). We managed to reach the gate 6 mins prior to the 'last' boarding call but they had ""closed the doors for an early departure"" and refused to allow my wife and I onto the plane. They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight. They attempted no form of compensation or even an apology and acted as if it were our fault and that they were doing us a favor by 'allowing' us to get the terrible seats. The worst of it though is their claim to be both Military and Handicap friendly but they fail in both."
10795,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,3,NO,Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced. United Airlines is an airline that I will use in the future only when I can't afford the alternatives.
10796,United Airlines,14-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,5,NO,Flew from Okinawa Japan with final destination at D.C. Dulles (IAD) with stops at Narita (NRT)-Tokyo and Chicago O'Hare-ORD. Flight from Okinawa to Tokyo is always through ANA since United contracts them out to and from Tokyo to Okinawa. I then flew a 747 Economy Plus from NRT to ORD. Waste of money to upgrade to Economy Plus. A little more leg room and width but that is it. Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money. Seats felt tight and cramped and I noticed absolutely no under the seat room for bags or stretching out? Onboard departure was chaotic as people couldn't store their luggage in overhead bins.
10797,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,4,NO,"Flight on April 22 2014 was delayed and then cancelled. After sitting and being told the takeoff was being delayed 3x they finally cancelled the flight. Announcing casually that it was cancelled and everyone needed to go to Customer Service. No warning. No ""We are really sorry."" No approaching the customer to help us out."
10798,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,UK,5,Economy,4,NO,I've had an awful experience both times I've flown with United. The first time all my flights were over booked and delayed. (Two flights there and back due to connections.) They gave us very little information about why and were extremely pushy when finally getting us to board the plane. We spent a long time sitting in the plane after being boarded with no explanation before we finally took off. They offered compensation to take a later flight but I had already been delayed for 2+ hours! On the more recent flight the flight was overbooked and I was unable to get on. There were no other flights out of YYC to SEA and I ended up having to cancel my trip. They have not been helpful when I tried to contact them. They told me they were transferring me to International Customer Service but I was just disconnected! I would not recommend United. Avoid them if you can!
10799,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I can honestly say this was the worst trip I have had in 20 years. Seat allocation is by far the worst especially if you are travelling with children. Chances of getting seats together are slim. My 11 year old wasn't even allocated a seat regardless how many times we tried online prior to flying and we booked last June. After a lot of stress got a seat but not together. They over book all flights and offer people compensation if they take another flight. Or offer you an upgrade to get all seats together as they tried with us for an extra��80 each. As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us �150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money. They could learn a thing or too from EasyJet as regards to seating. The food was good is the only positive experience. I would never use again.
10800,United Airlines,13-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,I am sitting in First EWR-LHR so can't complain too much but I'm shocked at how a global first customer is treated. First I had to argue with the gate agent at the entrance to the global first/global services lobby who said I was not allowed in. I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services. I know now why I usually just take Lufthansa and connect through Germany for their grace and ease. It is amply clear that we million miler 1k fliers just aren't worth much at united. Why bother being loyal.
10801,United Airlines,11-Jun-14,USA,10,Economy,3,YES,My flight out of Austin to San Francisco was delayed over an hour which caused me to miss my next flight. That flight was the last one out of SF for the night. The 3 people at the counter in Austin told me bluntly that there would be no compensation for the fact that I was going to stay the night sleeping in the terminal in SF. When I arrived in SF I went to the counter in Terminal 1 looking to get my boarding pass for the next day. I was handed hotel and food vouchers. I use United because they're the only carrier out of my smallish town (Chico CA) and before getting that voucher I had promised myself never to use United and to drive the almost 2 hours to Sacramento to use another carrier.
10802,United Airlines,11-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,1,YES,My first trip to Asia IAD-SFO-ICN (Seoul Incheon) and back. A319 from IAD to SFO was small first class seats were old and not great. FA's were good food was OK Flew global first on a 747 to Seoul. Toilets stopped working half way through the flight and we landed in Osaka for repairs. Delayed my trip by two hours but the crew handled it well. Return flights was upstairs in business first seat was narrow but not bad IFE was good food was also good. SFO to IAD on a 757-200 that had to be 25 years old with CRT IFE from 1990. FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers. If so maybe a few less seats in business class get away from 2-4-2 configuration and perhaps better first class seating in the domestic fleet.
10803,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,Italy,1,First Class,0,NO,I fly with United because it is one the few alternatives to fly directly to Bogota. They do not respect the seat assignments. On 2 occasions they changed without explanation even though I had paid for economy plus set they sent me to the back I had to really fight to get one in economy plus. On a 5 hour international flight they give you nothing just a drink. No entertainment.
10804,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,UK,1,Economy,4,NO,"I flew First Class on UA14 HNL-EWR. The plane was clean and the entertainment system was excellent. The food however was inedible. What they called ""chicken cacciatore"" was really a piece of cardboard. I have had better food in Coach on other airlines. Service on the flight was de minimus. The flight crew seemed only interested in finishing the pitiful dinner service as quickly as possible. Nobody flies for the food but United sets the bar for the worst food and catering in the industry. I thought Delta had poor food (which they do) but by comparison they look pretty good."
10805,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,As a long time Continental customer and I really am trying to like United but they sure make it difficult. This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.
10806,United Airlines,9-Jun-14,Qatar,8,Economy,1,YES,LAX-NRT-LAX (en-route to BKK) BizFirst on UA's new 787. Service both directions was really top notch. The crew were professional and attentive and on both legs the International Service Co-ordinator came to personally thank each passenger for their business and for choosing United (I thought that added a very nice touch). Meals were actually quite good and the wine parings worked well. Opted for the Japanese meal on the return and found it pleasantly delicious (including the array of sushi appetizers). The best thing about the trip was the aircraft. Arrived refreshed and didn't feel like I'd spent 12 hours in an airplane upon landing. Would recommend flying the a/c wherever possible. Overall high marks for this flight.
10807,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,5,NO,Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them. Their service is light years ahead of United. And when you pay a premium for a Virgin seat you have real perks coming with it. Not bait and deceit.
10808,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Most excruciating flight I have endured was the 757 UA flight from Newark to Oslo on 5 April. The seats in economy were sadistically cramped. The aisle was so narrow that the crew could not move their carts without repeatedly banging and bumping into passenger seats. United's utter contempt for its customers and its crews is all too evident in its creation of such a tortuous experience. United has finally jumped the shark in the cheap cheesy penny-pinching department. I can choose to fly another airline and believe me I will.
10809,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,UK,2,Economy,1,NO,"This was our worst experience. United Airlines had already been the airline with the most customer complaints and proved to be true when we took a trip to Florida. On the way back our flight for 3pm had been delayed for 5pm and then was cancelled due to ""maintenance issues."" We took another flight for 8pm and again was delayed to 9.30pm. We asked the lady at the counter and she said that the cabin crew wasn't prepared for travel so they delayed the flight. They are disorganized and I will never be flying United again."
10810,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,UK,2,Economy,5,YES,United Express: I flew from ORD to ASE in March and although they have us over a barrel as they are the only airline with non- stops the flight wasn't bad. We had to cram into a little regional jet definitely much smaller than United's traditional mainline aircraft but it was a relatively new plane. The seats did seem smaller but the service was jut about the same as its big brother. The fare was on the high side though.
10811,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,Ireland,7,Economy,2,YES,"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam. The economy plus seating is better than normal economy though although I'm not sure it compares favorably with other airlines' economy."
10812,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,4,Economy,3,NO,HNL to BKK. Aborted take off in HNL. Plane back to ramp sit inside plane for 5 hours. Problem could not be fixed mechanical. Flight cancelled. Told to disembark get out luggage at Arrivals and go to Departure area to rebook. This on a 747 with 350 plus people on it - all pulling their luggage about 1/2 mile to Departure area. Line up at departure area United to re-book - wait 7 hours to get to counter. Only 2 staff members to rebook the entire airplane. I was put on Delta the next day to NRT. Gave me $10 voucher for meals and over night free stay in Waikiki hotel. Cheapest meal at hotel was $18. Next AM Delta took off on time got me to TKO then transfer to United back to BKK. Never again with United!
10813,United Airlines,6-Jun-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I flew from DCA-EWR on Monday April 14. It was a mess United cancelled all of its flight out of DC without any reason. The weather was perfect my flight was suppose to be at 11.30am they cancelled it then I was put on the 4.30pm which was delayed and finally at 6.30pm they decided to cancel. They don't think of their passengers they don't respect their time this airline is really the worst airline I've ever flown. Would not recommend.
10814,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,UK,7,Business,5,NO,London Heathrow-Chicago O'Hare UA0929. Chicago O�Hare Intl-Denver UA1014 29th May 2013. Denver-Rapid City UA4914. Rapid City-Chicago O�Hare UA4414. Chicago O�Hare-London Heathrow UK. UA0938 23rd June 2013. I cannot understand United are not upping their care for its customers. We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers). So quite obviously the economy passengers do not matter remembering of course that it is economy passengers that are the bulk of their customers.
10815,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.
10816,United Airlines,5-Jun-14,USA,7,Business,2,NO,"I recently was on a United flight from DFW to ORD with my two small children (3 years and 10 months). After takeoff it became necessary for me to change my daughter's diaper. I pressed the flight attendant button and told the man that I needed to utilize the restroom with my daughter but since the lavatory was so small it was impossible to bring my 3 year old son with me. I asked if he could keep an eye on him just to ensure he stayed seated. I was told very tersely that this was not his job and he couldn't possibly do such a thing. I tried contacting United and got the following response ""The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants."" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers."
10817,United Airlines,4-Jun-14,Poland,10,Economy,3,YES,"SFO-LAX and LAX-LHR - in the recent past this airline has made my no-fly list for being unreliable to the point of fitting the description of ""not fit for purpose"" so I was reluctant to use them on this routing but had no choice as it was part of a Star Alliance mileage redemption. In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn't ask for more so they're off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this. All we need now is to get rid of the ghastly 90s photoshop globe with the wonky perspective and bring back the Saul Bass tulip."
10818,United Airlines,3-Jun-14,Russia,10,Economy,4,NO,First time when we used united airlines international connecting flight in San Francisco we notice their system are very disorganised in their terminal no one to help and most staff are not helpful. On another experience coming back from LAX going back to Sydney the staff at check were the same - all unhelpful. All they did was stand and talk among themselves.
10819,United Airlines,30-May-14,UK,7,Premium,4,NO,United Airlines was a disaster to travel through and not worth the amount of stress they cause all of their passengers. I was on a 7 hour flight and they had all movies and shows on repeat. The staff were very unhelpful. My flight ended up getting cancelled and I got re-routed to a much longer flight pattern. There were others I could have taken but United were SO unhelpful that I didn't find out until after the flight. The people there have no idea what they're doing. I was a day late for an important meeting. I received nothing in return for the inconvenience.
10820,United Airlines,29-May-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,SAN-IAH-AMS LHR-LAX-SAN in economy plus. Planes were clean service was professional and pleasant food decent IFE was very good and my baggage arrived with me. One flight segment IAH-AMS was 40 minutes late departing but arrived on time thanks to strong tailwinds. No complaints.
10821,United Airlines,29-May-14,USA,5,Business,1,NO,We were on the last leg of our trip at Denver Airport when out flight had been delayed 5 times. After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers. I will pay great amounts of money and drive hours to other airports to never use this airline again.
10822,United Airlines,28-May-14,Netherlands,8,Economy,2,NO,United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.
10823,United Airlines,28-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.
10824,United Airlines,28-May-14,USA,5,Economy,5,NO,I recently flew First Class on United # 15 from Newark to Honolulu. This is a 10+ hour non stop flight. The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland. My advice to people traveling on United is to bring your own food even in First Class!
10825,United Airlines,28-May-14,Canada,10,Business,1,YES,Flew SFO to PEK on 29th March in First and we had an exceptional crew. I'm not normally one to post positive reviews about United but they deserve this one. We found all flight attendants to be friendly eager to assist and they tried their best to meet all requests. The food was tasty and served at the appropriate temperature. It's still not exactly an elegant service but it's good.
10826,United Airlines,27-May-14,USA,8,Economy,1,NO,"I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable."
10827,United Airlines,27-May-14,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,Second time in 25 days connection return flight layover +3 hours plus delayed takeoff by 3 hours out of O'Hare. This time there wasn't even any weather issues. Also both trips had cancellations and overbooking. Why bother paying for poor service when I can actually drive home faster.
10828,United Airlines,26-May-14,USA,9,First Class,1,NO,I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.
10829,United Airlines,26-May-14,USA,2,Economy,5,YES,I flew from Heathrow to Charleston (SC) via Washington Dulles for vacation in late March. I flew UA123 which was a B757-200. This was an old plane but it had great AVOD and leg space and the staff were friendly. The flight was also early and very empty which is always a plus. The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service; nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating. Cabin crew were very helpful. I would definitely recommend United on the Heathrow - Washington route.
10830,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,First Class,2,NO,London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight. As I am writing this my baggage has still not been delivered.
10831,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,10,Business,1,NO,Narita Tokyo to Singapore Changi on March 28th. IFE did not work (and even if it did I would be stuck with according to what was in in-flight mag an old and poor quality selection) food awful and had to pay for wine on a transcontinental flight (a first for me). Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across. Purser who did not seem to be able to speak English and a captain who had obviously not been sent on any course about speaking to the public (lacklustre disjointed and very rare). Won't be booking anything with UA again.
10832,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Feb 2 from Newark to Punta Cana flight UA 1520 returned Feb 9 flight UA 1518. Traveled from Newark on March 21 flight UA 423 to Fort Myers. Returned on March 24 flight 1587. What a disappointment! It started at check-in at Newark airport they expect you to do everything and if you ask for help they make it seem they are doing you a huge favor. The seats are super tight have to pay for luggage food TV I'm surprised they don't charge to let you use the bathrooms! They make you feel like you are getting on a bus.
10833,United Airlines,25-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,YES,LAX-SFO-SEA-LAX in United First. Outbound legs to Seattle were great. Service was warm and personalized even if only snack basket and drinks were offered on these short runs. Where United really shined was on the return flight. Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays. Regardless the way they handled this one was flawless and I couldn't have asked for better service all-around.
10834,United Airlines,24-May-14,USA,5,First Class,3,NO,"4 Sectors with United YVR-ORD ORD-BOS BOS IAH IAH-YVR. Very poor customer service on the ground and in the air. Greeted at the aircraft door by the usual icy scowl. A ""good morning"" from me totally ignored on all sectors. Officious cabin crew. A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days. I can tolerate the ancillary charges the cramped seating the lack of food I understand that's what most of the budget conscience travelers demand these days. But simple manners courtesy and mutual respect cost nothing to provide and sadly they seem to be the most difficult qualities to find in any US airline."
10835,United Airlines,24-May-14,Australia,6,Economy,2,NO,If there is any alternative to flying United take it. The staff do their best but everything about the interface is far from traveler-friendly. First of all the food - and this is in first class - can only be somebody's idea of comedy. Murky chalky flavors and strange un-natural textures characterized every dish I was given. Also on one recent Newark - Los Angeles flight there was were no screens in the plane - no movies no TV. No wireless available and no plugs.
10836,United Airlines,22-May-14,USA,1,Premium,5,NO,Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.
10837,United Airlines,22-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,The worst experience I have encountered when flying. Total disregard to their customers and employees. The poor people at the gate were just beat up to no end and it was not their fault. Flew out of Aspen Colorado which only has 6 gates and 2-3 planes to manage and they could not even accomplish this simple management. United changed my flight without even giving me the courtesy of an e-mail or phone call to check to see if this arrangement was ok. It wasn't even a change in a flight on the same day but they changed the day I was flying out changed from one layover to two layovers changed the total flight time and did not even offer an apology for this inconvenience. In the future the only way I will ever fly United again is if there was no other airline going to this location. A horrible experience.
10838,United Airlines,22-May-14,Canada,5,Economy,4,NO,I am on a flight to LAX from SFO already delayed by 45 mins waiting for flight crew to arrive. This had already given me a pretty good idea of customer service the flight's staff has to offer but that got solidified when I asked for 2 cups of water from one flight attendant and she told me - 'why don't you finish one first?'. She eventually got me another cup.
10839,United Airlines,21-May-14,USA,7,Economy,2,NO,First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.
10840,United Airlines,20-May-14,Australia,1,Business,5,NO,UA 861 from Washington to Rio de Janeiro scheduled to depart at 9.30pm. The flight was delayed first and then after making me wait for 5 hours the flight was finally cancelled due to mechanical problems at 3am. I got re- booked on the flight for the next day at the same time was given a night at hotel and $14 voucher for the meal for the whole day. The next day I found out that my connection to Sao Paulo to Rio no longer existed so was booked on a later flight with a regional airline. Basically what should've taken me 14 hours took me 48 hours. Furthermore my luggage arrived 2 days afterwards after several phone calls and different answers from United agents. The food served on the plane was inedible. Worst air travel experience. The seat was so crammed for a 9+ hour flight I had to buy premium economy on my way back so that my knees won't hurt.
10841,United Airlines,19-May-14,USA,5,Business,1,NO,Absolutely the worst flight. Both trips were delayed for aircraft mechanical issues. 3 hrs on the way there 4 hrs on the way back. I've never really liked United but we still fly because we were avid Continental flyers for years. I will make it a personal goal to avoid United as an airline for any future flights I have. The price was ridiculous and the service and crew were mediocre at best. I thought United had newer aircraft fleet. Then why are two flights delayed because of mechanical issues? I would never recommend flying United.
10842,United Airlines,18-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Milwaukee to Los Angeles March 16 2014 returned March 19 2014. Flight 5165. Flight 1273 missed this flight due to the above one being late next flight UA729. Return flight 1498 delayed and missed connecting flight 5438 rebooked to flight UA5425. Late flights and rude service. My flight leaving was late and missed connecting flight. On the return home my flight leaving and connecting flights were late. Flight attendant stands in aisle talking while we try to get off plane to make connecting flights. Captain had asked everyone to be seated unless you have a connecting flight.
10843,United Airlines,18-May-14,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,"I booked a return trip to Las Vegas via Dublin. On the return trip the seat in front of me was an emergency exit. The seat itself appeared to be broken when the passenger in this seat put the seat in the rest position the seat reclined back so far that the space left to me was extremely confined. When I asked the cabin crew if I was obliged to have this person sitting ""on top"" of me she stated he was allowed to put his seat back. As a result I sat for 6 hours approx with no reasonable space in front of me. I got no food as there was no room to let down my food tray."
10844,United Airlines,18-May-14,USA,6,Business,3,NO,Both coming from and going to our destination the check in staff were very rude and difficult to work with. We've always been around 50 pounds for our checked bags sometimes a little over sometimes less and most airlines don't care as long as you're close enough. Not United - it's 50 lbs exactly or they won't take your bags. Their check in staff are normally pretty unhappy and rude. What makes it even more ridiculous is most people just shift the weight to their carry-ons - meaning the airplane is still carrying the exact same amount of weight.
10845,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,4,Economy,1,NO,I recently flew from SFO to Cancun and back. First off I had to pay for poor entertainment offered inflight when other airlines offer better entertainment for free. I mean I paid for movies that I can't even pause when I use the restroom (ridiculous). Secondly no food was served for this long flight. Even some chips or light snacks would have helped. Thirdly the seats were meh I have had better seats. It is a forgettable experience except for the bad parts like the entertainment system. If given the chance I will not fly United again.
10846,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,6,Premium,1,YES,UA838 BKK-NRT Biz class. Flight was packed. Wonder why UA would discontinue BKK with the planed loaded with passengers. Laid flat seat. Sat on the upper deck near the cockpit. UA Biz were pretty crowded. Food was mediocre. Breakfast choices were Thai noodle or omelette. Grilled sandwich prior to landing was delicious.
10847,United Airlines,17-May-14,UK,6,First Class,4,YES,UA79 EWR-NRT Biz-First. This is a long haul flight about 14 hours on a Boeing Dreamliner with staggered seats. Would have been nice for privacy but unfortunately seated next to a guy who had cold and sneezed around most of the time. Mid flight snack placed in the galley was minimum. When I went there most were gone. Toilet was poorly stocked with only 1 liquid soap bottle. Flight crews were nice. Amenity kit came in a lousy tin can but it is said to be a collectible one.
10848,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,8,Economy,5,YES,UA29 14/03/14. Friday evening departure from Newark and the airport was busy however the check in and bag drop facility was well organised so wasn't queuing long. Onboard the flight the 777 was full so it did feel quite claustrophobic the seats were not very comfortable but the legroom was ample. The flight only took 6 hours 15 minutes but the cabin crew were friendly and worked really hard and managed the meal service and two drinks runs before turning the lights off. Breakfast was served an hour and half before landing and consisted of a warm croissant and a small fruit salad. The flight landed ahead of schedule in to Heathrow and I was again fairly impressed with United.
10849,United Airlines,17-May-14,USA,1,Business,4,NO,UA 468 SFO-PHX First Class. UA 1265 PHX-EWR First class. Typical domestic UA first which is nothing more than a bigger seat and free food. Ordered SW Chicken salad but got tasty beef with noodle instead. First class fare is not reasonable. If purchased separately way too expensive for what you get.
10850,United Airlines,14-May-14,USA,1,Premium,4,YES,UA838 NRT-SFO Biz class. This is a long haul flight with amenity bag. Japanese food selection was Okay. Mid flight snack was placed quietly in a galley. Good thing was the arrival lounge at the SFO to freshen up and shower after landing. This lounge closed at noon and quite difficult to locate. It is on a lower level on the way to terminal 3 if you walk from the international terminal. Info desk did not know about the UA arrival lounge.
10851,United Airlines,13-May-14,USA,7,Economy,1,YES,UA 837 NRT-BKK Biz. Sat on the upper deck to avoid the large Biz crowd. Flight was so packed. Hope UA consider to continue its operation to BKK again in the near future. Food was mediocre with beef steak. Japanese crews were polite and nice.
10852,United Airlines,13-May-14,Canada,7,Economy,2,NO,March 12th 2014 flight UA200 was okay but we landed in Houston an hour late and were told our connecting flight UA5189 was cancelled. We were at Terminal B and at this point the service provided by United Airline Airport staff was very poor. Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th. The only saving grace was Air Canada offered free movies. We flew UA1715 and UA219 March 4 2014. Very long uncomfortable flight-no entertainment unless you paid. Very poor experience.
10853,United Airlines,13-May-14,Switzerland,10,Business,1,YES,UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.
10854,United Airlines,13-May-14,USA,1,Business,3,NO,March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!
10855,United Airlines,13-May-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.
10856,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,"UA5713 New York City NY - New York-LaGuardia (LGA) to Washington DC - Washington-Dulles (IAD)�on 3/13/14. The new round of checks on size of carry on is being handled in a way that has convinced me that I should never fly United again. While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude. I am convinced the lack of space in carry on bins will no longer be a problem because any business traveler or preferred customer will have enough sense to fly with another airline. It is amazing how far United will go to alienate it's good customers."
10857,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,8,Economy,1,YES,Birmingham (BHX) to West Palm Beach (PBI) via Newark (EWR) Business Class. Outbound 25 Feb Inbound 10/11 Mar. Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs. All in all the whole experience was a pleasant one I would recommend this airline for people in the West Midlands flying to the US albeit travelling in Business makes a difference but the premium economy and economy cabin looked to be ok as well.
10858,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,8,Economy,5,NO,On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff. I did not receive my luggage until 50 hours after my flight landed.
10859,United Airlines,12-May-14,USA,1,Business,1,YES,Flew SLC to ORD then ORD to DCA both flights were great. The crew on both were very friendly and professional. We arrived early on both flights. I was in economy plus so plenty of leg room. Direct tv was available on ORD to DCA leg. I have flown a few of the discount airlines lately and was reminded how nice it is to fly United. Great trip!
10860,United Airlines,11-May-14,Germany,1,First Class,2,NO,Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip. I will not be flying United next vacation that is for sure.
10861,United Airlines,11-May-14,USA,6,Economy,4,YES,Flew VIE-FRA-IAD on 5 Jan 14 all economy. First leg was on LH1237 on a A321 second leg UA933 on a B777. Was prepared for a steerage experience on UA but felt the economy seat was surprisingly comfortable and the dinner ok as well. However there was a charge for wine/beer on this international flight of 9 hrs. I contrast this with the LH flight from VIE: complimentary sandwich and complementary wine/beer on a 90 min. flight! Try getting that on a US domestic flight!
10862,United Airlines,9-May-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,"I flew to Nashville via a connection in Houston. The first flight a 60 seater was overbooked by 7! The gate agent was totally overwhelmed. When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure. Aircraft taxied for 15 minutes then sat on the runway for 20 minutes. Not one word from the cockpit. Upon arrival in Houston we sat for 10 minutes until someone showed up to pull up the boarding bridge."
10863,United Airlines,9-May-14,New Zealand,0,Economy,2,NO,We had a connecting flight from Chicago to Montreal at 7.30pm and boarding time was at 7.00pm. Got to the airport 2 hours before our flight and decided to get a bite to eat in the terminal but first we checked the screens and our flight was on time. Left the restaurant 30 mins before boarding when we go to the flight screens we had seen that it said cancelled we did not understand why? Told that the crew had not shown up and that there were no other flights available meaning we were stuck in Chicago until the next morning. 5am wake up to catch the new flight they had scheduled us on. Got to the agent at our gate and saw the agents panicking told it would take 30 minutes to get the problem sorted. To top it off my father booked a first class seat the plane did not have a first class so he asked for an exit row seat however they wanted to charge him almost 40$ when he had already had a first class seat to begin with.
10864,United Airlines,8-May-14,Italy,8,Premium,3,NO,"Booked a flight in December 2013 for a trip to Palm Springs in March 2014 - at that time had seat assignment - little did I know that booking in advance does not guarantee you a seat on the flight - they over booked the flight and I was bumped off my 7 am flight and spent 15 hours in San Fran airport compliments of United Airlines. Waited all day to get on a standby flight (7 that went through that day all over booked) - would have been bumped from the 11 pm flight they rescheduled me on (after bumping me in the am) had I not checked to make sure I was ""guaranteed"" on the flight. Make sure that when you check in your ticket has a seat assignment - if it says ""see agent"" make sure you go early and hopefully get it taken care off - What a terrible disregard for peoples time from United. Feel bad for the ticket agents who I watched all day get yelled at by others who were bumped unwillingly!"
10865,United Airlines,7-May-14,Canada,2,Economy,2,NO,Possibly the worst airline to fly internationally. Such a shame compared to other European and Asian airlines. Traveled on the ORD-MUN. Flight was delayed due to leakage in cargo. Apparently they found it after every one boarded the plane. Planes are ageing. Entertainment system kept rebooting automatically. Each reboot taking 5 minutes. Service was pathetic. FA's never tried to help. Beverage rounds were few and in between. Overall has been a very bad experience whenever I have flown United. Avoid it like plague.
10866,United Airlines,6-May-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,I am forced to fly by United Airlines from were I live because they are the only airline at my local airport. I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen. No power outlet for electronics and flight attendants that made you afraid to ask for a drink of water.
10867,United Airlines,5-May-14,Belgium,8,Economy,3,NO,I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work. This is just one of many times I have had trouble with this airline I will not be flying again.
10868,United Airlines,5-May-14,UK,7,Economy,1,NO,Returning to Michigan from Waikiki we got to Chicago where we found out that the plane to Detroit was cancelled. When we went to the service desk they acted like they did not care told that we could be put on stand by until the next open flight in 3 days had a seat. Their customer service was rude and uncaring. Luckily our travel agent called American Airlines and got us a flight in one hour.
10869,United Airlines,4-May-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,Flew United SYD-SFO in Economy Plus. Paid $200 for exit row seat so unlimited legroom. Staff business like but not rude. Soft drinks offered soon after takeoff. Dinner was basic but that was actually welcome - steamed chicken 4 slightly shrivelled chips veg tiny Apple pie drinks offered again. Water was offered twice during overnight and a midnight ham roll and Tim Tam for those awake. Breakfast was omelette and barely recognisable sausage. IFE was shared screens but I used iPad. Overall not as unpleasant as I had feared.
10870,United Airlines,4-May-14,Canada,10,Economy,2,NO,Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight. I still have no idea what happened in SLC it seemed to me like a lot of laziness and poor customer service.
10871,United Airlines,2-May-14,Germany,1,Economy,2,YES,Flew Dublin - Newark - Washington Dulles on 6th March on a B757 and then a D8. The cross Atlantic flight was fine on time reasonable seat good choice of movies etc. but the food was very poor - potatoes hard as was the bread no choice - it was meat or meat. On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks. Not sure it helps and fail to see the logic of filling from the front back - getting the people at the back in first means less blocked aisles.
10872,United Airlines,2-May-14,Canada,5,Economy,1,NO,It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.
10873,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,NRT-BKK. Uneventful trip on a route about to be abandoned by United. Surprising considering the 747 was packed to the brim. Boarding was chaotic and those of us in business class had no idea where to line up to board. Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though. Pilot had Channel 9 (air traffic control) activated which is one of the nice features that only United can claim. The RCC lounge at NRT has much to be desired - hands down had the worst cappuccino in my life there.
10874,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,10,Premium,2,NO,"Flew from Newark to Denver where United decided without any form of communication to hold 2 of our bags to arrive with the next flight to Denver 3 hours later. After arriving in Denver we waited at the baggage carousel for nearly an hour until we were fully convinced 2 of our bags did not make the flight. Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us. On our flight back from Denver to Newark the entire flight was boarded seat belts fastened welcomed by the pilot until another announcement from the pilot came on and I quote ""there is a small problem. Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes"". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this ""quick fix problem"" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives. Nearly an hour later we finally get up to the representatives and all I hear is a potential flight to Houston reboard the out-of-commission plane at 3.30 or wait until tomorrow. Save yourselves the trouble and aggravation and never fly United Airlines!"
10875,United Airlines,2-May-14,USA,1,Premium,1,YES,LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.
10876,United Airlines,1-May-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Traveling out of New Orleans Louis Armstrong airport for business around 2 pm on 3/5/14. Baggage check was totally disorganized. I was directed to a kiosk by one of the agents then waited 15 minutes after I had checked the bag electronically for someone to come and tag it. When an agent showed up to tag the bag they were clearly not in a hurry. Then my flight was delayed. Maybe there's no rush at check in because United flights are late so often.
10877,United Airlines,1-May-14,Netherlands,5,Economy,4,NO,Washington to San Diego and San Francisco to Washington. Old planes not enough overhead storage for the amount of cabin luggage they allow people to lug in. One stewardess had a shouting discussion about the oncoming superbowl from the front of the plane to row 39. No free food on a 5 hour flight no drinks except water and fruit juices of doubtful quality. Online entertainment is a joke! Never again!
10878,United Airlines,30-Apr-14,Israel,8,Business,3,YES,Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.
10879,United Airlines,29-Apr-14,Canada,10,Business,1,YES,"LHR-IAH-GUA. Prebooked upgrade 3 wks before travel. Check in easy with assistance from staff. Flight left on time and arrived on time in Houston. Flight attendants were friendly and the food was pretty average. You pay for your own alcohol which I don't have a problem with but theirs is expensive. Entertainment selection ok. Prem econ seats offer nothing more than extra legroom about 4"" but was worth it on long haul. Nothing to complain about there and using Houston for transit we were impressed with the speedy immigration channels which took much of the hassle out of using the States. IAH-GUA also on time and again a typical short flight with nothing special but nothing to complain about."
10880,United Airlines,29-Apr-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,I used to like flying United but the last couple of trips have really make me think about other airlines. I had to fly to Honolulu in January to take care of my mom for 2 weeks. They canceled my departing flight. My flight from Houston was delayed 2 hours and there was no personal TV on the flight. Flying home it was the same. I had to return to Honolulu in Feb. The flight to and from had no personal TV. I am not a savy personal and do not have I- pads or any personal electronics (and there were many other people like me on the plane) so using Wi-Fi did us no good. Sitting on the plan for 8 hrs plus with no entertainment really did not go over well.
10881,United Airlines,29-Apr-14,UK,3,First Class,1,NO,May 27 through June 10 2014.�The customer service for this airline really needs to be greatly improved. I book my flights in advance so I can have what I want and schedule what I am doing when I get there. So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes. Next time I think I will book with another company that I have had no problems with.
10882,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,YES,LAS-LAX-RNO. One way trip at the last moment due to family matters. Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means. A smile on either end goes a long ways. I have done many short and long hauls with United over the years and only once did I have an issue. United has treated me well and has my business.
10883,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,Canada,1,Economy,1,NO,I've been a United 1K member for 2 years 7 year Platinum member on Continental prior to the merger of the two airlines. I fly over 100k miles a year on business and used to enjoy flying however over the past 3 years United has been a nightmare to fly and do business with! Loyalty means nothing customer service is non-existent and upgrades uncommon. Schedules are terrible with multiple connections expensive tickets and they're flying more and more excruciatingly uncomfortable regional planes! Been flying a different airline starting this year since they offered elite status for flying a few thousand miles during a certain timeline so far so good!
10884,United Airlines,28-Apr-14,Australia,9,Economy,4,NO,"Hong Kong to Newark on March 1. Flight crew was tired and cranky with bad attitudes across the board. One in- flight announcement was literally a snide ""buckle your seat belt it's bumpy"". Where other airlines turn a galley into a quasi-lounge area during such a long flight (15 hours) we were told there was to be no loitering around the galley or toilet areas. I will avoid this airline as much as possible in future. The only positives were the entertainment system and that the flight was on time."
10885,United Airlines,26-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,My wife and a friend were flying to San Francisco last night and their flight was delayed from 8pm to 9.30pm. When they were finally on board they found that no meals of any kind were available on the 5 hour flight to the destination. My wife was only able to get two small glasses of water and a glass of tomato juice. If this is a sample of the way that United Airlines treats it's passengers these days we won't be booking any travel with them in the future.
10886,United Airlines,25-Apr-14,Belgium,1,Economy,3,NO,United cancelled our flight to Florida about 16 hours prior to our trip. You would think that with 16 hours to work with they could find a way to get a plane to the city I live in. Our travel agent had to scramble to make alternate arrangements with another airline. Now we are going to have to spend over twelve hours travelling and stop at one more airport. I am very angry with United's lack of compassion with our dilemma and diligence at arranging alternate flights to get us to our destination. I will never book with United Airlines again!
10887,United Airlines,24-Apr-14,USA,9,Economy,1,NO,EWR to AUA round trip business class. The flights were the flights from hell. The crew was unpleasant. The plane was very old and should have been retired long ago. The food if you want to call it that was awful to say the least. I'm easy going and I couldn't find anything positive to say. Save your money and never go UA business class.
10888,United Airlines,24-Apr-14,USA,3,Premium,1,NO,Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home. I will be flying on other carriers from now on.
10889,United Airlines,24-Apr-14,Canada,6,Premium,1,NO,"Just arrived at my hotel after a horrendous 24-hour trip from Montreal to Honolulu. The missed connection and re- routing through LAX was bad enough but I guess winter weather is a reality. What is not acceptable is this new DirecTV-United deal for in-flight ""entertainment"". Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they've got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map. Of course they'll say it's only $6-8 for DirecTV and provides access to many TV channels as well."
10890,United Airlines,23-Apr-14,UK,5,Economy,2,YES,EWR-ZRH onboard 767-400. Rolled away from gate right on time landed in Zurich one hour early. 2-1-2 business class configuration great if traveling alone. Had center single seat which was comfortable and private. Classic movies on IFE was wonderful. Food was decent. Service was efficient but indifferent. Definitely no smiles.
10891,United Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,My wife and 22 month old son are about to board a 14 hour flight. United is only offering one meal service over that 14 hour period and they won't give any food to my son because he's on his mothers lap and doesn't have his own individual ticket. Some milk maybe some yoghurt a ham sandwich costs them what maybe $2? It's apparent that that extra $2 is worth more than the comfort of their lowly economy customers. Flying isn't what it used to be.
10892,United Airlines,23-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,"Terrible service unless you are some sort of elite status traveler. This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in. Assigned me and my 9 year old son Exit row seats because the flight was completely oversold. When I advised gate attendant that a 9 year old would be in the exit row they stated that I ""shouldn't have agreed to the terms and conditions of those seats"". Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it. After 40 minutes everyone else gets on plane I go up to find out what's going on and I'm then given back my original boarding passes and told to get on the plane and they would fix it there. Onboard told to see the 2nd attendant. The 2nd attendant tells me I can't sit in the exit row with a child. An attendant moved 2 people out of their seats into the exit row and then snidely says to me ""See. that wasn't so bad was it?"". I've taken 4 United round trips in the last 5 years and pretty much determined that this kind of attitude is common."
10893,United Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,4,YES,LHR-ORD on 25 Feb. Flight departed on time and arrived 40 min early. 2 of 3 FA's good with prompt service. Third was trying but seemed befuddled at multi-tasking thus often a step or two behind. Nice touch that rather than leave the mid flight option at the galley they did a more formalized service. Food on primary meal was so-so for example my tilapia and shrimp had no tilapia. The per-arrival burrito was actually quite good. Seats were comfortable though a bit narrow and limited space to neighbor.
10894,United Airlines,22-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"EWR (NJ) direct to POS (Trinidad). The United Club was unfortunate and so was the outdated 737-800 (UA1505) that took us to our Christmas vacation. Save your money folks and fly coach. This class of service is not worth the extra cost. I would say the worst part about flying United is the unenthusiastic and unhelpful service. No big surprise to anyone who flies United regularly. I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The ""fine print"" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you're doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is. You will also be allowed to buy this product which I now have deep regret doing."
10895,United Airlines,20-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,3,NO,"Our last series of flights (from the UK to the USA and also within the USA) were quite simply the worst travel experience we have had in over 30 years of being regular international and national travellers. Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us ""we won't look after this anybody can take it and it's not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United's configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don't know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two. It is very sad to see the appalling way that United Airlines' service has plummeted."
10896,United Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,9,Business,3,NO,FLL to EWR to SFO. UA1024 for the EWR leg firstly the pilot taxied too close to the corner and got stuck in snow. Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.
10897,United Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,4,NO,I'm currently sitting at the gate for my United flight at LAX. A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on. She kept getting flights confused and putting out wrong information. I will make sure I don't fly with them again.
10898,United Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,7,Business,1,YES,2 flights Feb 14 and Feb 17 LAX-SFO both last about 1 hour. Check in was a breeze though the process within LAX domestic wing can be a bit testy. Full flight on both ways with only drinks service given on economy. No entertainment system just some random loop of Olympic commercial. Flight attendants are organized and accommodating. Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout. Flights used ancient 737 and 757 on this leg so it can get stuffy. It wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either just something that will get you from point a to b without much fuss.
10899,United Airlines,17-Apr-14,USA,6,Premium,1,NO,0 for 3! United Airlines failed to depart all of my flights this week on time by greater than an hour. Two of which were in excess of 2 hours. This resulted in my decision to cancel my last leg (which I was going to miss anyway) with them and drive 5 hours in the middle of the night to get to my destination. I didn't want to take the risk of staying overnight and not getting home. Apparently they don't have any concern for their customers and their timelines. Probably won't fly with them again.
10900,United Airlines,16-Apr-14,USA,8,Economy,1,NO,PSP-Houston-Washington-Ottawa. Arrived 1 hour and 45 mins prior to departure. In PSP they had 3 flights (Denver San Fran and Houston) all leaving within 30 mins. They had 3 attendants each flight left without people who were left in line because of the counter delays. Staff were less than helpful. No organization no communication. We got to the gate with 5 mins to spare. On the Houston - Washington segment they arrived with time left on the inflight movie - so no one saw the ending. I will not use United again.
10901,United Airlines,16-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Really simple flight from Los Angeles CA to Newark NJ at 11.30pm then a connecting flight from Newark NJ to Boston MA (1.5 hrs buffer). Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10 000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston. Total travel time ended up being over 17 hours. Horrible experience inept customer service.
10902,United Airlines,16-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,"Flew FRA-EWR and IAD-FRA last week and I have to confess: flying United is like blind tasting every-flavor beans. Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient. Even the meals were rather delicious as far as airline food goes. There was plenty of drinks throughout the flight frequent updates from the crew and we even cut down a 40min delay to an on-time arrival to FRA - altogether an enjoyable travel experience."
10903,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,YWG-ORD-FLL-ORD-YWG. Check seemed more complicated than other carriers but did manage to figure it out. Left YWG on-time. Arrived into ORD more or less on time. Had 50 minutes to get to next gate which was miles away. Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher. The only shop that was open was a McDonald's which was in the American Airlines terminal which was miles away. Winnipeggers don't have much choice in air travel but I will do my best to avoid United in the future.
10904,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,LAX-JFK EWR-LAX. Pros: two helpful ground agents and warm friendly lounge staff at LAX. Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner. I only flew UA as a code share with AirNZ but can honestly say I will never ever waste my time or money again.
10905,United Airlines,15-Apr-14,UK,1,Economy,1,NO,"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies""."
10906,United Airlines,14-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"My sister wife and I travelled Heathrow to Chicago to Denver and onto Minot ND. Booked meals asked for veggie for me on the first flight. Lousy onboard service Chicago chaotic. Flight on small jet to Minot was excellent. return was via Washington. Lousy flight uncomfortable seats on United tight for me at 6'3"" on board attendants no patience. Food again on return was unplanned."
10907,United Airlines,12-Apr-14,USA,8,Premium,1,NO,"Planned a vacation to Australia and New Zealand over a year ago! Left EWR on Jan 22 for SFO flight was delayed almost 2 hours (waited about 40 mins to take off) most of the delay was caused by a mechanical problem. Pilot apologized for problem saw mechanic going back and forth down aisle. Had a connecting flight to Sydney with 1.5 hr layover. Notified flight attendant about connection and pilot contacted United to let them know that there were a number of people on the flight connecting to Sydney. Was told plane was taking off ""on time"" Got into SFO in enough time to make connection but sat on tarmac for 20 mins. waiting for gate. No gate agent no transportation - just run. Got to gate at 10.42 doors closed at 10.40. United's response - tough. One flight a day to Sydney. Customer service said EWR flight was delayed due to weather (untrue) therefore no compensation. Was upgraded to First class for following days flight. One hour before departure United takes away our first class tickets and gives seats to United employees (saw the badge) - unbelievable! Don't want to bore you with the return flights but suffice it to say had to spend two nights in SFO of course no compensation."
10908,United Airlines,12-Apr-14,UK,9,Economy,5,NO,I flew United on domestic US flights 3 times in last month and I am very disappointed by their customer care. They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$. I was forced to check the carry-on luggage as they found they had no free space onboard. Of course my hand luggage was an appropriate size. I am very disappointed and will do my best not to use United Airlines again.
10909,United Airlines,11-Apr-14,Australia,1,Economy,1,YES,I was very pleased with the service I received on United during the recent bout of nasty weather. I left Charlotte going to Chicago and then onto Duluth MN. My Charlotte-Chicago flight was cancelled due to the weather and the agent here in Charlotte handled things quite professionally. The same held true in O'Hare when flying back to Charlotte. It was snowing pretty hard in Chicago and a number of flights were already cancelled. I asked to be rebooked on an earlier flight that was scheduled to go out. Again the agent handled things quite well. I wish all carriers had airport staff as professional as those at United.
10910,United Airlines,9-Apr-14,USA,9,Economy,1,YES,We just finished a trip to Belize from Edmonton Canada. This was our first time using a US airline. We flew with United and we were pleasantly surprised. Our only real issue was that the TV's were not available.
10911,United Airlines,8-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,Flight from HNL to Denver has been sitting at gate for 2 hrs and no information given other than cargo door problem. I quit flying United several years ago but booked this flight due to price. Never again. Will now miss my connecting flight to DSM. Will not make this mistake using this airline again. On flight over to HNL the entertainment system did not work.
10912,United Airlines,7-Apr-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,Worst airline I have ever been on. So far UAL has cancelled 3 flights from EWR to BOS with the excuses being weather crew and now mechanical. That's 3 separate planes. Seats in economy are tight with virtually no movement. I'll never fly them again.
10913,United Airlines,7-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Arrived Tullamarine (Melbourne Australia) for long planned family holiday to USA. Informed flight cancelled and next flight was two days away! No apology no explanation. Flights through to LA and then to New York uneventful. Flight home from JFK - baggage issues plane delayed on tarmac for close to two hours no amenities from staff water etc. LA connection end then delayed by non appearing traveller. Flight to Sydney diverted to Brisbane due to low fuel missed connecting flights and luggage 'lost' (arrived 11pm four days later). United never again.
10914,United Airlines,3-Apr-14,Canada,6,Economy,1,YES,GLA-EWR-MCO return. Transatlantic flights were pretty decent considering they were on a 757-200. The staff were friendly enough and the food both ways was fine either chicken beef or veggie option soft drinks free pay for alcohol. Flights in the US were OK with more legroom than the transatlantic flights and both were pretty much on time. Overall a decent enough product if you don't set your expectations too high and with United flying direct to the US from Glasgow I would use them again for the convenience of not flying via London or Amsterdam.
10915,United Airlines,3-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,YOW-ORD-HNL-LIH and return HNL-ORD-YOW. We were lucky to have a great inflight crew both ways. Perhaps the inflight crew was in a great mood going to Hawaii and as well maybe a very relaxed crew returning home. Goes to show you what a difference in a great attitude makes. The passengers were also very co-operative. We did leave Chicago 3 hours late. We had to finally switch planes. Good thing that the replacement plane had the same seat configuration which avoided a lot of chaos. Wish all my flights were as positive as this one.
10916,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,4,NO,Worst airline and worst customer service anyone can ever imagine. 4 hour delay on the plane then cancellation next morning again 4 hour delay while sitting on the plane and then cancellation. 3rd day waiting for an hour to get my luggage checked in when there were only 3 people in front of me. Staff had no idea. This was from Regina to Denver. By the time we were done with staff we were already late for boarding.
10917,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,1,Economy,3,YES,Just returned from a 3 week trip LHR-ORD-SEA returned ACV-SFO-LHR much better flight with united then previous flights in 2013. Inflight entertainment much improved food pretty much the same flew economy plus cabin free alcohol outbound but alcohol charged on the inbound flights. Far greater than Virgin Atlantic will fly United again when I travel in two months.
10918,United Airlines,2-Apr-14,USA,5,Economy,1,NO,Just flew United to Honolulu from Canada. Worst possible flight from Chicago. No entertainment no WiFi and absolutely no food or snacks were given. Mechanical issue delayed us for 2 hrs. Will never fly United again.
10919,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,My husband's father passed away 2 days ago. We scrambled to get him on a flight that wasn't too terribly expensive and would get him there in an expeditious manner. He flew from LAX to SFO. The plane he was supposed to be on in SFO had mechanical difficulties. They brought in another plane from Vegas. This second plane had problems as well. It took an additional 5.5 hours for him to get on his way to his family.
10920,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,UK,1,First Class,4,YES,Flew LAX-SFO-ORD-LAX last week in First. Had a really enjoyable service and even with a 45 minute weather delay due to incoming aircraft off the east coast still arrived in O'Hare relatively punctual. Outbound aircraft was the 737-900 with Boeing Sky Interior - which is very calming for a 4.5 hour flight. The only drawback was it was so new that the IFE hadn't been installed yet (not a deal-breaker as I normally read/work). Return aircraft 757-200 International config with on-demand. The best part of the trip were the crew. Both directions they were attentive and intuitive. They learned my drink order upon getting settled in and never had to ask again (with repeated re-fills). Menus have been upgraded and for a domestic First it was a great experience and worth the ticket.
10921,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,7,Business,1,NO,Delay of 4 hours then cancellation with another 4 hour wait for customer service on scheduled flight from SFO to HNL is totally unforgivable and there were no weather issues involved. Date of travel was to be 18 Jan 2014 and rebooked on 19 Jan 2014. Definitely cannot recommend United ever again.
10922,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,Singapore,1,Premium,3,NO,Took several flights in the last couple of months from EWR-HKG ORD-HKG NRT-EWR. The only positive item is inflight entertainment on the 777. Food: first meal - barely edible snack: unedible (half frozen sandwich) third meal: terrible. Now United have started charging for wine on such flights which last year didn't. Staff: terrible: I was given terrible attitude by a flight attendant didn't respond to several attendant calls for a long time. There are several airlines doing such routes all of them providing far better service than United.
10923,United Airlines,1-Apr-14,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,Flew from HKG-ORD and ORD to IAD. I had very low expectations on United. Surprisingly HKG-ORD ultra long haul flight has excellent service. Probably this is because the flight is staffed by Hong Kong-based crews. The 777-200ER aircraft has decent AVOD. Food is average but the crews offer multiple drink runs throughout the flight. ORD to IAD domestic flight is normal US standard. Only drink is served. PTV is useless unless you pay to watch Direct TV. Service by cabin crew very average. The experience is 4 star for the international flight and I would not hesitate to fly United if Hong Kong crews serve the flight.
10924,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,USA,4,Economy,4,NO,My pregnant wife and I had to fly to Maryland from Hawaii. As we were leaving for the airport I get a notification that the plane was experiencing mechanical issues and the flight was delayed. I contacted them and discussed how our delay was going to affect our connecting flight in San Francisco. I was told it would not be an issue. Upon arrival in San Francisco I learned that was not the case. I was told we had to wait a few hours and was going to Houston where I would be connected to Baltimore. We arrived in Houston and was greeted by another rude employee telling us the delay caused us to miss the connector to Baltimore and would get us a later flight putting us in Baltimore around 10pm and that was our only option. I walked outside to get some air and saw a supervisor at the ticket counter. I explained the story to her she offered to get on a flight that would put us in DC. On our arrival we learned that after what was to be a 12-13 hour flight that turned into a twenty something hour flight zig zagging across country. United did not have our luggage and it was sitting in an airport in New Jersey.
10925,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,New Zealand,2,Economy,1,NO,Flight from Houston to SLC on 2/1/2014 a family of six including a 6 year old 4 year old and twin 2 year olds. When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.
10926,United Airlines,28-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one. To give them 1 star for each of these categories is a stretch. I wish I had read the reviews before booking so many flights with them as it seems that the rest of their previous customers are just as satisfied as I. Literally days wasted in airports and kilometres walked trying to get answers from staff who clearly are in the wrong line of work given their communication skills. Never again.
10927,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,1,First Class,1,NO,"DEN-LHR on Christmas Eve. No food service for 50% of Economy class cabin as crew claimed that ground staff forgot to load enough food for all passengers in this class due to ""holiday mood"". When complained to crew they said it is unfortunate and can send letter to head office if dis-satisfied with service. Last time to fly with UA."
10928,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.
10929,United Airlines,27-Mar-14,USA,6,First Class,3,NO,I took United from Paris to Washington DC and then from DC to Richmond VA. The first flight was ok despite no communication or service from the crew. The second flight has one hour delay so far. Not very happy about flying with United. I won't recommend it.
10930,United Airlines,26-Mar-14,USA,1,Business,2,NO,We flew from Newark to Panama City Panama. Flight arrived 30 mins late at 11pm. The flight was OK except for no entertainment as the paying entertainment was not worth it. No free food even that had to be paid for - we didn't. Pilots were pretty uncommunicative and the cabin crew indifferent. The seats are real torture too narrow hard and poor legroom combine to make 5 hours feel like forever!
10931,United Airlines,25-Mar-14,Canada,2,Economy,1,YES,ORD-FLL on 18 January. Paid for upgrade to 1st class as a birthday treat! Very helpful staff at ORD to assist with check-in. As a Star Alliance Gold with A3 following security checks I was able to use the Club Lounge facilities. Being morning items for a continental type breakfast were available. The lounge was however very busy. The flight boarded on time and departed 30 minutes late due to airport operational issues at FLL. (out of&nbsp; the control of UA) Orders for breakfast were taken prior to departure (2 choices) and delivered in a friendly way while en-route. The aircraft B737-800 appeared new the cabin was clean and comfortable. In spite of the late departure the flight arrived in FLL around 5 minutes late.
10932,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,Flew Denver to Tokyo Flight left 2 hrs. late (mech) so we missed our connecting flight arrived 9 hrs late. On the way back they changed our seats at boarding and put us next to the bathroom got to hear the toilet flush and the door slam for 10 hours I'll never fly United again.
10933,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,1,YES,IAD to DEN. Economy class on a 757. On time for departure and arrival quite good service from attendants. Aircraft sported outdated overhead CRT for in flight entertainment and my audio jack didn't work correctly. Also no wifi or power outlets. Seats comfy but a little small. Had to pay 9 dollars for a large snack which is too much frankly. Fine for the low fare I got but not much else.
10934,United Airlines,24-Mar-14,Ireland,4,Economy,1,NO,We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel. Very frustrating trip with United!
10935,United Airlines,22-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,1,NO,IAH to CVG: Crowded dirty late with poor customer service from distracted personnel. They act like they simply don't care. If you enjoy riding Greyhound Bus Lines and want to have that same experience in the air fly United.
10936,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,USA,1,Business,2,NO,I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.
10937,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,7,Business,3,YES,I personally have had few problems with them over the last several months. Recently did DEN-SFO-HNL and back. All flights on time and with early arrivals DEN-SFO segments with newer aircraft with PTVs. The SFO-HNL segments were on the oldest 777 I have ever seen - no food no entertainment nothing for 5 hours is not really acceptable. Crews smiled on all segments and actually seemed happy to be at work which is a change. Ground staff at SFO were also helpful.
10938,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,6,Economy,3,NO,Flew United 261 LAX to Orlando Economy Plus. No music no movie (not even plug for headset) only ability to purchase wifi for $9.99. Remodelled seats with less padding.
10939,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,UK,1,Economy,5,NO,Beijing to Chicago leg of world trip. Completely full flight seats are ridiculously tight all around even for a slender person toilets a mess service dismal - did not respond to 3 different customer call buttons for over 45 minutes. Arrived safely and on time. No more long haul flights on United as Singapore is the winner for economy class.
10940,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,With our flight leaving Jan 6 and no seat assignments we went to the airport the night of the 5th and stood in line for 2 hrs waiting to see a ticket agent. A very nice agent was able to secure seats on our flight. Same thing on the way back. Again in San Francisco no seat assignment. 33 people had to stand in line at the gate and have boarding passes re-issued with their seat assignments. Then people in group 4 and 5 had to go back to the gate counter to check our bags because of limited overhead storage. Two things in closing. Expect a big headache if flying out of S/F and I will try to find any other airline before I fly United.
10941,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,"San Francisco to Seattle return four weeks later in First Class. Cabin Crew were wonderful and free drinks including alcohol but for a two hour flight in First Class no food was offered but a bag of crisps not really acceptable. But what lets this airline down and why I will never fly with them again is the rudeness and incompetence of their ground crew. Checking in at Seattle there was a problem with our reservation even though we had a confirmation booking. We were referred to a very rude female attendant who informed us that we would have to telephone Air New Zealand to solve the problem. We had no USA coins to make a phone call yet she said to us ""I have a big queue of people to deal with I cannot help you"". If this is how United treat their First Class Passengers I would hate to be a passenger in Coach! Never again with United!"
10942,United Airlines,19-Mar-14,Thailand,1,Economy,3,NO,Ticket from London to San Jose with connecting flight in Chicago overall quite disappointing. Food and the entertainment system were only available for purchase (flight length: 6 hour). Staff was extremely impolite and non competent: we ask to have information regarding connecting flight procedures and most of the indication received were not correct: they reassure us that our luggage was already checked in therefore no need to check in again once in US. As soon as we landed we discover that indeed we HAD to go through custom with our luggage and therefore check in again. They reassured us that there would have been someone to come to pick us up at the plane in order to help as with the connecting flight procedure. No one came to pick us up at arrival but the United counter outside custom was left unattended / empty for at least 15 minutes (which result in us missing the connecting flight).
10943,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,Canada,1,Economy,2,YES,Melbourne to San Francisco. United are phasing out the 747 and replacing it with the newer 777. The main issues I had was with the seat width with no where to put your arms without rubbing the passenger sitting next to you. On a 14 hour flight it is quite stressful having someone invade your personal space. The foods service was also very ordinary and basic in comparison to other airlines offering e.g. Qantas. Unfortunately United offers the fastest and most direct routes to Australia from San Francisco when compared to the other carriers I.e.Qantas Virgin Australia. Flight Attendants are attentive and work hard. The actual inflight experience needs to improve. Headset jack in seat was broken but had my own entertainment from my iPad.
10944,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,UK,7,Premium,5,NO,I flew from New Orleans to Sao Paulo with connecting flight from Chicago to Sao Paulo. I had no room to put overnight bag in overhead bin and was told to find a place or go check baggage. The food was horrible. My seat didn't recline and asked for help and attendant didn't return. Will never fly United again and will not recommend them.
10945,United Airlines,18-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,My flight from Houston to Kansas City was scheduled at 11.20 am. The scheduled arriving time of the incoming aircraft from Monterray was 11.33 and arrived at 11.31. How to keep the schedule keeping in mind that a change of aircraft from international to domestic flight takes approx. one hour? It demonstrates that arriving on time by flying United is pure luck. And of course no announcement in advance. The information at the airport was awaiting incoming aircraft.
10946,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,3,Economy,3,YES,MAN-EWR-MAN. Premium economy out and regular back. First experience with United and also first time transatlantic on a narrow body. Seats were fine legroom in economy plus a bonus but other than that no benefits over standard economy. Staff pleasant flights on time and seats reasonably comfortable. Food was very good as was seat back entertainment. Only minor issue was the need to keep carry on under seats due to overheads being full. Would recommend and certainly use again. Point to point beats wasting time in transit.
10947,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,2,Premium,3,NO,Arrived at the airport an hour early as expected and the flight was oversold. The agent refused to check us in or check my bags great reception for a family of 3 first class passengers as she said we weren't there 1.5 hours beforehand. Gate agent stalled until the flight departed and continued to say she was having trouble entering passports until all the connections had left and could only rebook the next day.
10948,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,UK,2,Economy,4,NO,"I make a round trip flight from the west coast to Japan every 3 months. Usually fly with Korean or Hawaiian. This time because the price was a little less. I flew on United/ANA. The people staff were friendly but the space in the cabin was by far tighter than any of the other carriers that we have used over the last year. When you are on a 12-15 hour flight it makes a big difference. Space - not acceptable baggage allowance - not acceptable food - barely acceptable. Total: chose a different carrier (unless you are 5'2"" or less and saving $50 is the only consideration)."
10949,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,San Francisco to Tokyo. The entertainment system did not work for first couple of hours. The distance between the seats is terrible (on the way back I used ANA the distance is much-much bigger). All lavatories were dirty and smelt. For the broken entertainment system they told us to go to their site and apply for some kind of reward. A month later and nothing. No more United!
10950,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,2,Economy,5,NO,Stockholm - Newark - Las Vegas - Chicago - London. Like many others I got stuck in Newark due to the weather problems which I guess is out of United's control. However throughout the process of finding a new flight I felt like all ground staff just wanted to get rid of me. Never did they express any type of sympathy for my stressful situation. On the way back United did not manage to check me in on a connecting flight with a Star Alliance partner (so much for the seamless experience). They did not offer any real help to solve the problem either and just referred me to my travel agency. Later I learned that it was actually United themselves that had caused the problem when rebooking my outbound flight without updating the all legs of the journey! The actual flight experience was not that great poor food old planes poor entertainment systems grumpy ladies serving drinks etc.
10951,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,Canada,5,First Class,2,YES,UA 1065 EWR-MEX. I scored a last minute upgrade which made the trip very enjoyable. The Business service was quite good. Only fault is catering doesn't match their printed menus. I would've preferred the pasta but there are only two pasta entrees from catering so I had the fish. It was decent. Flight crew extraordinarily friendly.
10952,United Airlines,17-Mar-14,USA,10,Economy,4,NO,Flew on LHR-EWR route. On our way out to NY was just what you expected from an airline of this reputation nothing special average performance. However on 6th Jan from EWR to LHR on UA0044 I can only describe the whole experience as hell. Turned up at the airport at 6am 3 hrs ahead of our flight waited patiently in the long line. When we got to an agent she told me I may have a seat but my hubby has a standby ticket because the flight is oversold. I tried to question the absurdity (we bought tickets a year ago flew the week before and turned up at the airport 3 hrs early for check-in). Puzzled and panicking we went through security believing that there was some sort of mistake. Proceeded to our gate hoping to speak to someone but there were already plenty of people like us lining up asking similar questions. We had to wait until everyone was on board. Until they closed the gate eventually around 11 I had never heard a single apology from the 3 ladies at the gate. Eventually told there were no seats left and told to go to customer service with some food vouchers and some check to clear. Still no apology no explanation. We finally got on a plane that night and only to find that our bags were missing when we got to LHR. Seats ok food awful crew needs some training on PA and would be really nice to see some smiley faces if possible.
10953,United Airlines,14-Mar-14,USA,8,First Class,2,NO,After boarding flight 1120 from San Diego to Chicago the steward announced that we would be deplaning because there was no pilot. 3 hours later the new pilot announced that the delay was caused by United who sent the scheduled crew to San Francisco the night before putting them over the new regulations for rest time between flights. He said United knew this and failed to schedule a new crew or alert passengers timely. I missed my Connection in Chicago. The bad weather set in and I spent two nights in Chicago. Instead of a direct flight to Harrisburg on Monday I had to connect at D.C I missed that connection because of a weight imbalance on the plane and ended up spending over $230 to rent a car to drive to Harrisburg. I understand weather delays but I would have been home before the storm set in if United hadn't screwed up big time.
10954,United Airlines,13-Mar-14,Canada,2,Premium,1,NO,My international flight from Seattle to Narita on Jan 6th was average in quality and I was about as comfortable as one can be on a 14 hour flight. The connecting flight from KCI to Denver on Jan 5th was atrocious and for no good reason at all. While a huge number of flights into and out of Denver were being canceled due to weather this incidental connecting flight was delayed for hours because of poor planning. Boarding was delayed because the plane's heating system failed. When we did board it was still freezing. The de-icing process also took longer than expected. When we finally arrived in Denver we were told to wait in the longest customer service line I had ever seen. All of us were wasting our time. We waited 3 hours to be told we should have left on a flight that left about an hour after we landed. The customer service workers in Denver and Seattle were very helpful and very overworked but I'm sorry to say they are the exception to the rule. Most were capable but unwilling to help. All of my other flights with United have been completely average nothing to complain about and most have been international. For the most part United is a pretty average airline. But if you get in a pickle the poor quality of the majority of United's staff is likely to snowball your problems and delays.
10955,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,3,First Class,1,NO,Booked with a family of 6 from Orlando to Houston to Vancouver. No notice that check-in line was 7 hrs because of storms in North East. Our flight was delayed to the point we could not connect in Houston. We were encouraged to go on standby. We were never placed on the standby list by the United Staff member. However our luggage left. We were also told that failing the standby flight we were booked on a flight 5 days later. When I called to confirm two days later there was a reported 12 hour hold queue. Finally got through to United to be told we were not booked on any flight to return. It appears the staff member only told us what we wanted to hear to get us out of the airport - nothing they said was true. Flew Westjet home. I understand that weather happens but deal with the resulting issues with some honesty and class. I will never deal with United again. 3 days home and still no luggage.
10956,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,5,Business,2,NO,"I will never fly United ever again. Leaving from LAX-ELP United decided to do ""maintenance"" on the aircraft before it takes off which set us back 2 hours in departure which meant most everyone was going to miss their connecting flight in Denver. We were redirected to the customer service which took 1.5 hrs standing in line to finally be told that there were no flights until the next day that could take me home. Ridiculous. At least they had the decency to pay for the hotel. Next day fly out to Denver waiting for my connecting flight to ELP there is a 30 minute delay again because of ""maintenance"". Plane supposed to leave at 3 at 4 they tell us that we are changing gates and plane so more delays and we are still waiting to know what time they decide to leave since apparently we are running on their time schedule. I cannot believe how unorganized this airline is and how they make traveling so torturous."
10957,United Airlines,12-Mar-14,USA,9,Business,1,NO,What a horrible experience and lack of customer service. I flew from Boston MA with a connecting flight from Washington Dulles to Atlanta. I was scheduled to arrive at 2.45 but I did not arrive until 7.45pm. To top it all off our bags did not arrive either. We were shuffled from gate to gate then to another terminal. There were no weather delays whatsoever and no explanation was offered. When our airplane finally taxied off we still had to wait on the runway because the airplane had no fuel. Then I was told my luggage was arriving at 1 am. It is now 5 pm the next day and I have been given an eta but still no bag. Needless to say I will not be flying United again. The lack of customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
10958,United Airlines,11-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,1,NO,Flew United from Tokyo Japan to Bangkok Thailand. Pretty disappointing. Despite being a fairly long international flight there was no real entertainment choices like on most other airlines. Service was friendly enough. We had a delay of four hours and United did not even let us know which was also disappointing. Got us from point A to point B but with no frills or exceeding of expectations.
10959,United Airlines,11-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,San Francisco to Hong Kong with United was substandard in every regard. Firstly boarding was a disorganized mess. Once on board the decrepit old plane was woefully short of enough storage space for customer's bags. Twice a stressed out crew member stood on my seat without really excusing herself to try and cram bags into the overhead storage. Next I was dismayed and shocked to discover we had shared TV screens on a 14.5 hour flight. Scheduling a plane for such a long flight that has shared TV screens is ridiculous. Thirdly I was baffled by the fact that United now charges for alcohol on international flights - the only airline to do so. I do not expect to have to pay for a glass of wine with my dinner on a 14 hour plus flight. I suspect that United will lose a lot of international customers with this short sighted and stingy policy. Next problem was that my vegetarian meal that I had booked weeks before wasn't available. I had to make do with scraps that the crew could find. So shared TV charged for alcohol my reserved meal unavailable and an old uncomfortable and falling apart plane. Why would anyone choose to fly with an old fashioned and out of touch airline?
10960,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,Australia,1,Economy,3,NO,"I arrived in Chicago at 4.30pm and was supposed to be on a connecting flight to Mobile AL at 6.30 arriving around 8.30. After being at the airport about 10 minutes the flight was delayed until 9.30. 10 minutes later it was pushed up to 8.30. An hour later we got delayed until 9.30 and had a gate change. 30 minutes later we were delayed until 10.00 and another gate change. As soon as we got to that gate we were informed we had been delayed yet again until 10.30 and that we had another gate change in a completely different terminal building. By the time we got to that terminal the flight had been cancelled. They told us the next flight to mobile wasn't leaving for 24 hours. We eventually got to New Orleans and had to rent a car to drive home. United had no remorse and their response was ""sorry""."
10961,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,USA,10,Economy,2,NO,"We were a family of 4 with 2 children under 7 traveling from San Francisco to Mexico City. United has the only direct service between these 2 cities and we have flown the route perhaps 10 times in the past. The flight to Mexico used to be a morning one but now it is an inconvenient night flight. The legroom was very tight on the Boeing 737 but everything went to plan. Return flight was an early morning flight and we arrived at the airport at 4.30am and were informed that the flight had been cancelled due to ""no crew"". Waited in line over 5 hours to talk to a ticket agent and she put us on standby to Houston and to connect from there. Got called at the gate and told only two of us could go which was ridiculous. We spent 18 hours meeting flights at various gates and told to come back in the morning. We got hotel vouchers but only after insisting. The following morning we were given a confirmed flight a full week from our scheduled flight so I booked a flight with American Airlines through Dallas to San Francisco. Check-in was electronic and we only had to stand in line for 30 minutes to check the baggage. This fiasco cost us an extra $2000."
10962,United Airlines,10-Mar-14,UK,5,Premium,4,NO,Flew from San Jose CR to London ON. Dec 20th. Flight to Houston was ok. Flight to Chicago O'Hare was delayed due to engine trouble. By the time I made it O'Hare airport I was told my flight to London had been cancelled and I needed to go to customer services. I waited in that line for 4 hrs. Told they could fly me to London on Sunday 2 days away from then. A manager told me she could fly me into Toronto the next morning but I would need to find my own way from there. She also informed me that I will be getting a reimbursement for my travel from Toronto to London. To make me feel better they gave me a hotel and food vouchers (this was around 1am and my flight was at 7am). I was also informed my bags would take about 2-3 hrs to get or and I could leave them there and they will send them to Toronto. Well the next day everything went normally. Except my luggage never made it out of Chicago. That took another 3 days to show up.
10963,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,SJO-ORD - Flight cancelled. Flew SJO-IAD-ORD. Worst customer service. Tried to contact local number for 1.5 hrs with no answer. Service is bad food is very marginal flight attendants and personnel at counter were rude.
10964,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Premium,3,NO,December 31 2013 flew from Tampa to Saskatoon SK. Flight from Tampa to Chicago was good. Problems started in Chicago. First plane had problems with power outage broken air conditioning system trouble restarting engines after they had been shut down and a long wait for de-icing. Finally we were allowed off the plane after sitting for over two hours. Next plane scheduled for us had a flat tyre and frozen toilet. Third plane had a frozen toilet which seemed to be fixed by a bevy of maintenance men carrying buckets of hot water. Very little information received from airline staff. Received $7 food voucher that we could only use at a Starbucks as everything else in the airport was closed. Customer service reps would rebook flights but would not issue hotel vouchers because our flight had not be cancelled. We finally got off the ground 7 hours late. Not a nice way to end a holiday.
10965,United Airlines,7-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,I was scheduled to fly out of Dulles Airport on Jan 6 2014. I showed up to the airport to check in and found out that my flight to El Salvador was cancelled. No one had taken the time to notify me of the cancellation. Everyone I asked was rude and bothered by my questions. I waited in line for 3.5 hours to reschedule my flight two days later. The entire experience was horrible. All other flights at Dulles were able to take off except for United. I didn't expect the same bad service from them again but unfortunately nothing has changed.
10966,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Australia,1,Premium,4,NO,MSN-DVE-SMF. Horrible experience. The flight delays I can live with its winter. However what I don't understand was why no beverage service the attendant said there wasn't time to refresh the stock. Then in Denver we're delayed again ok its snowing I get it. The gate attendant was friendly and said we would be on the plane in an hour which we were. But what he didn't say was we would sit on the ramp waiting for the crew for 2 hours. Why board the passengers without the crew present? And the cabin was blazing hot it must have been 85f in there why? The last few inches the airlines have squeezed out has really made a difference for me. The gate attendant told use to hold our coats in our lap so the carry on luggage would fit well that's fine but we paid $50 to check our bags so we wouldn't have to sit with bags and coats in our lap in a much to cramped space.
10967,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"I was scheduled on a direct flight from Pittsburgh to Denver 1/5/14 at 7.20am. The check in line was crazy it was a busy travel day but they must have been understaffed because no other major airlines had lines like that. After waiting in line for 1 hour and 15 minutes I made my way through security and to the gate. There was no bad weather here or there so I was feeling confident. 5 minutes before boarding the sign at the gate changed from ""On time"" to 'Cancelled'. We were not given any information but told to call the 800 number. I waited in line for 3 hours at the desk only to be told the soonest they could get me to Denver was 10pm the following evening. Since I was travelling for work and could not arrive two days late I went down to collect my bags which took 45 minutes to arrive and a worker down there said the flights were cancelled because the crew were over their hours. That seems like a problem that should have been anticipated. It was my worst travel experience ever."
10968,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Austria,9,Premium,1,YES,The east coast storm pandemonium caused many flight cancellations including mine but phone agent was easily able to rebook me on the next available flight out of the New York area without too much trouble. Check in on the other hand wasn't as seamless with wait times being long even whilst using premier access understandable though due to airport congestion from weather delays. Flew on UA's newest 737-900 aircraft from Newark to SFO - the dimmed mood lights offered a soothing atmosphere albeit the squished seat. Shockingly service was actually existent on this flight by cabin crew with frequent drink runs and cheerful interactions which is a rare for me on this airline. Food however was an issue with the meals for sale having run out by the first few rows leaving many passengers to be starved on a 6.5 hour flight. A pre order option should at least be available if they're going to charge passengers for food on such a long flight. The friendly and inviting service continued on my second leg from SFO to Orange County bringing me to rethink my position on United.
10969,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,Canada,1,Economy,4,NO,"Try sitting through a 17 hour flight from Sydney to San Francisco with only a Jane Austin movie and similar rubbish as your main entertainment on the front screen. I took the precaution of checking the United website prior to booking with them for the first and last time. I was very concerned that spending the better part of an entire day on a plane required individual entertainment units to stop prison-like boredom. The website stated that all United Airlines planes from Sydney to the USA are 747-500 and all are fitted with individual entertainment units. There was no proviso that this ""luxury"" did not extend beyond business class into Premium economy where I was seated. My plane left Sydney over 3 hours late causing me to miss my connecting flight to New York I had to wait more than 8 hours at the airport. The situation only got worse on my return flight. The official reason stated by the captain for the more-than 4 hour delayed departure was that flight crew had to arrive at Newark from Oakland CA. The reason given by United in the boarding lounge to their customers was that there would be a short delay while they waited for catering and fuelling. Had the airline any integrity and any concern for their passengers (especially those with international connecting flights) they would have announced at the scheduled boarding time that there would be a delay of approximately 4-5 hours. This may just have given me time to organise another flight to LAX which would have connected to my flight to Australia. The message is simple: if you need reliability fly another airline."
10970,United Airlines,6-Mar-14,UK,2,Economy,3,NO,I booked a flight for my son from MIA to Toronto (MIA to IAD: UA511) and (IAD to YYZ: UA6146). Flight 511 departed 2 hours late. At Washington Dulles he found the flight 6146 was cancelled. Told he'd be in a waiting list for a later flight (UA6126) which was also cancelled. No explanation and no respect for passengers. If today flights have been cancelled I am not sure tomorrow flights will be departing with the weather getting worse so what happens with the people that have their plans classes that will restart on Monday as in the case of my son. In my entire life I never felt so angry and frustrated with an airline and never faced a situation like this.
10971,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,9,Premium,2,NO,NRT-SFO-NRT. Has to be the worst airline I have flown! All flights were late food inedible crew extremely rude and unhelpful. Toilet had a pool of urine on the floor and trays were snatched from passengers.
10972,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Unhelpful and rude staff who didn't communicate what was happening. Due to a 4.5 hour delay for flight leaving New York I missed my connecting flight and asked them to rebook only to be told the next flight in 24 hours was full. They wouldn't pay for a nights accommodation and the only option they gave me was a 15 hour flight 11 hour wait at another airport then taking the final leg home (to NZ). They also lost my luggage and tried denying any responsibility. Will never fly this airline again.
10973,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,5,YES,Newark-Tokyo via Frankfurt. Check-in was absolutely absurd. Since I had an International flight with 2 different carriers United and All Nippon Airways and not a US Citizen the self check-in kiosk was not letting me check- in. I was calling the United ground staff for 10 minutes and was finally approached by one of them - I wouldn't blame them actually the counters were obviously short staffed. When they weighed my bags they told me I had to remove half a pound! In addition the flight was delayed 4 hours. Fortunately while we were waiting we were given food vouchers and other amenities. United finally opened a counter for passengers with connecting flights and they were trying the find other flights going to Tokyo from Frankfurt at a later time than the scheduled one. United made an announcement that the flight was cancelled. Finally from then onwards United handled the situation very well. They opened several service counters for airline representatives to rebook passengers flights. They quickly rebooked me on a direct non-stop flight to Tokyo the following morning and provided me and all other passengers with hotel rooms and an additional food vouchers worth US$40. A week later they even compensated for the trouble caused.
10974,United Airlines,5-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"Checked in for a flight to Tokyo 2 hours early and was told by United staff that I ""needed to run"" to my flight to make it on time. I cleared security and ran for 15 minutes with a backpack on through Bangkok's massive Suvarnabhumi airport. After arriving at the gate I was forced to go through several more rounds of security before boarding and waiting 2 hours for them to fix a problem. After that we waited an additional 50 minutes because of miscommunication between the pilot and air traffic control. Landed in Tokyo late and had to run to my connecting flight to make it on time. Tokyo flight was again delayed getting off the ground by almost an hour. Arrived late in Hawaii and had to run to my connecting flight to make it on board with minutes to spare. FAs were friendly and nice but staff involved in boarding are overly authoritative and rude. My flight to Thailand with United was also stressful full of delays and clumsy. They also regularly cancel fights with no notice."
10975,United Airlines,4-Mar-14,Canada,5,First Class,2,NO,Worst travel experience ever. LHR-IAD-CLE 3 Jan 2014. I understand flights were cancelled due to weather but that's no excuse for the horrible United customer service on the phone at the gate on the aircraft and at the customer service counter. Everyone we talked to gave us a different answer which eventually lead to an additional 13 hours of travel. American or Delta will get my domestic and International business from here forward.
10976,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,USA,9,First Class,1,NO,My first and undoubtedly last time flying United. The experience started out bad and then went downhill from there. On the first flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago we had to disembark before take-off because of a broken hydraulic the delay was a few hours and we barely made our connecting flight. The second flight Chicago to Nashville was delayed because the lavatory staff never showed up to empty the bathrooms. Our first flight home was delayed because of a broken intercom. The connecting flight home Chicago to Pittsburgh was supposed to take off at 1.28pm and arrive at destination at 3.49pm. We boarded the plane and waited for take off then were told to disembark because there was no flight crew. What they promised to be a short wait turned into six hours. Six hours of sitting at the gate with a $7 food voucher hoping a crew would eventually be found. The woman at the desk encouraged us to go to customer service but the employee at the end of that line told us the wait was too long and we should return to our gate. Unfortunately later flights to Pittsburgh were all booked to capacity. When a crew was finally found hours later they were greeted by us like celebrities. Once the crew was settled the passengers were boarded and the plane was de-iced the eventual take-off time was 7.30 six hours after it was supposed to. The only positive part about this flight was the kindness of the pilots and flight attendants. Their sweet attitudes and understanding were what kept us from completely melting down. United did offer us a discount for a future flight but it really isn't a fitting compensation for the huge inconvenience they caused us.
10977,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,Canada,1,First Class,1,NO,"I was flying to South Dakota and on the way there United Airlines caused us to miss our connecting flight they made us check our bag at the gate but would not bring them up to the plane until the last possible minute and this was after sitting on the runway for 20 minutes with no explanation as to why. On our 5.40 am return flight we heard another passenger saying that her flight from Chicago to Atlanta had been canceled. We had received no notification no e-mails or anything notifying us that our connecting flight had been canceled. Put on the 7.00 flight. When we went to the gate (over an hour early) we watched as the flight changed times and gates multiple times when we finally thought everything was over and we were going to board soon I looked up at the standby screen and saw that the seat that was on my boarding pass had been given away. When I went up to the counter all I was told was that ""We have no record of your reservation someone else has your seats. Sorry"". We were sent from person to person at the counter. Told all they could do was put us on standby even though we had the boarding passes in our hands with the seat numbers. Finally able to get seats on the flight that was supposed to take off at 7.45 finally pulled out onto the runway at 9.45. The is the worst flying experience of my life and I will never set foot on a United flight again."
10978,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Dulles to LAX - flight delayed 2+ hours not one edible thing offered for free for 5 hour flight and they even charged to watch the flight map! The attendants were a nice bunch of people but otherwise a truly unfriendly skies experience.
10979,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,USA,1,Economy,1,NO,"I recently flew SYD-LAX with United. The last time I flew United was 30 years ago and I'm sure this was the same aircraft and same crew as I had on that flight. I cannot believe they are still flying 747-400s between Sydney and USA. This time I had my teenager travelling with me - no on-demand entertainment and no tablets for hire made for a very unpleasant 19 hours - in seats that feel like an iron bench and staff that have learned 100 ways to say ""No"" and I can say with complete certainty I will never fly United again."
10980,United Airlines,3-Mar-14,Canada,7,Premium,1,NO,"Shanghai to Nashville via Chicago Sep 2013. Delayed 2 hours leaving Shanghai sat on the runway for 2 hours instead of letting us sit in the airport. On the flight had several rude flight attendants. Flight ran out of wine in economy section 2 hours into a 14 hour flight! When they passed the meals we did not have the opportunity to look at a menu ahead of time to see what side dishes went with the entrees. The stewardess did not want to take the time to tell us what else was on the menu with each entree. Arrived late in Chicago. Asked United agent for assistance to catch our flight to Nashville. He said "" That isn't going to happen""! We waited in line over an hour to find out how we were to get home. Very unorganized and appeared short staffed at desk where we waited. Of course we missed the last flight of the day. Given a $7 voucher to eat dinner in Chicago and a $7 voucher to eat breakfast in Chicago the next day! Put up in a hotel for the night. Arrived home the next afternoon. I am very disappointed with their lack of customer service."
10981,United Airlines,28-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,5,NO,I used to fly United and Continental on a regular basis. The new seating and smaller bathrooms were horrible. We used frequent flyer points to travel and even with those will never fly this airline again. In fact we will pay twice as much just to not have to travel with them. I watched in horror as a father who took his baby into one of the newly configured bathrooms get stuck and unable to get out of the aforementioned bathroom. He had to put the baby on his shoulder and duck down to exit. This was not an exceptionally large man. The new pockets on the seat backs can't even hold a small book. Why put them there if they are useless? No more movies? If this is the new no frills airlines perhaps they should charge appropriately.
10982,United Airlines,27-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,2,NO,"The worst customer service experience ever! I purchased 3 round trip tickets and confirmed seating assignment 4 months ago. Today they automatically reassigned the seats for the 1st leg of the return to the very last row of the plane and split up the party. And would not provide any seat assignments for the 2nd leg of the trip. I called to get these re-adjusted and was told by their customer service manager ""to read the contract of carriage"". I've flown many airlines for many years and have never been so astonished by the rudeness and lack of willingness to service the customer."
10983,United Airlines,27-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,Dec 22 2013 flight 3429 to Greenville / Spartanburg S.C. returning on Dec 2013 to Chicago O'Hare flight 3429. My flight on Dec 22 was announced that it was delayed in the last hour before boarding. The information she kept giving us was not correct and kept announcing longer delays. Once on the plane we were told by the pilot and stewardess that the plane was being repaired which took 30 hrs so we actually had no plane right from the start and told of no delays until the last hour. I am very disappointed in this service and find this very unprofessional.
10984,United Airlines,27-Feb-14,USA,10,First Class,4,NO,Manchester - Washington Dulles on Boeing 757. I'm a regular traveller to the US and decided to give this route a go. Wish I hadn't. Single aisle aircraft is not a good idea on trans-atlantic routes. Moving around the plane was no so easy because of the single aisle. Had to pay for inflight drinks at about $7 a go. Meals were so-so. Service levels on US carriers not anything like as good as the European. Next time I will revert to the British Airways services via the wonderful Heathrow T5 - its worth the extra travel time for a superior inflight experience.
10985,United Airlines,26-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,3,NO,"We recently flew 4 times with United (Amsterdam-New York-Costa Rica-New York-Amsterdam). The flight to/from United Airlines is by far the worst airline a person could use for travel. Let me first start by saying we booked our flight for Dec24 2013 in early Oct with our seats assigned. We arrived at Louisville international Airport when they issued our tickets our seats were not together. We showed the counter help our booked flight and seats and she notified the supervisor who in turn changed our seats to be together. Then we arrive in Denver and we are boarding the second flight when we are told we needed to see the desk because there was a problem with my husbands ticket. The girl at the desk said she didn't know how to fix the issue so she notified the supervisor. He accused my husband of missing his first flight. Then he placed us once again in separate seats and when I told him that wasn't right his words to me were ""well then don't go"". This airline has no idea about good customer service. I'm dreading my trip back to Louisville this Sunday!"
10986,United Airlines,25-Feb-14,UK,2,First Class,1,YES,SAN-IAH-AMS/AMS-IAH-LAX-SAN in economy plus. Flights on time food on international segments decent planes clean IFE worked properly service friendly and baggage arrived with me. Travel met expectations. I've done this trip a few times previously and have never had a complaint.
10987,United Airlines,25-Feb-14,Canada,1,Economy,3,NO,Out of 5 flights none of which were on time. All were between a half an hour to a full hour late. My first three were to Alaska from New York with stops in D.C. and Denver. The result of these flights running late made it so I didn't have the time to stop and grab something to eat between planes. Not having a credit card the flight attendants would not allow me to purchase any food. The last of these late United-run planes was also veru unpleasant due to the screen being stuck on almost maximum brightness in front of my face the entire time I was trying to sleep because the armrest controls were not working. Arrived at the airport around the departure time of my connecting flight usually not a problem I've had airlines hold planes for me and others before but not this time. The plane left right as I got in. I am now stuck hundreds of miles from home. Luckily I had the opportunity to catch a flight only four hours later than my original on American Airlines. If that opportunity didn't arise I would have had to somehow stay in Chicago.
10988,United Airlines,25-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,2,NO,"We recently flew 4 times with United (Amsterdam-New York-Costa Rica-New York-Amsterdam). The flight to/from Amsterdam was reasonably OK. However we were very disappointed about that lack of courtesy by the stewardess. Instead of asking: ""Would you like the chicken or beef meal Sir"" she simply shouted ""chicken or beef"" and then shoved the tray in our hands with a brisk ""here"". Also no printed menus were provided to show the meal choices on forehand. The fasten seatbelt signs were left on for two hours (with only slight turbulence). I got told off for going to the toilet but my girlfriend had to wait nearly a quarter of an hour before the stewardess let her through to the toilets (although she first asked permission). During all that time she was left standing in the aisle because the staff did not want to shift the coffee trolley back a couple of rows. During this time the seatbelt signs were still on and there was turbulence. Very inconsiderate and inconsistent! The inflight entertainment system on the flight to/from Costa Rica was horrible. We saw the same short ""B-quality"" movie about 8 time. We noticed that only about half a dozen other passengers paid the required US$ 7.99 to watch the direcTV programs. On both flights United probably earned less than 100 US$ from this pay-per-view system that made 2% of the passengers happy and 98% miserable. Not even the flight map was provided for free!"
10989,United Airlines,25-Feb-14,USA,2,Economy,4,YES,DEN-EWR-CDG/CDG-IAD-DEN: Flew with United round-trip to Paris last week in economy plus. Flights all arrived on time(flight out of Newark was over an hour late departing but b/c of very strong tailwinds arrived on time in Paris). Both transatlantic flights had personal video which was nice meals were OK flight staff were professional. While the economy plus seats aren't any wider the extra legroom was a help on the flights. Based on this experience I'd fly United to Europe again.
10990,United Airlines,24-Feb-14,USA,3,Economy,1,NO,I booked a flight from Amarillo to Fargo with a connection in Denver. The flight was showing on time at the ticket counter. When I got to the gate the departure board showed the flight running 30 minutes late. I had a 3hr 45min. layover in Denver so I thought I was fine. The flight finally took off about 3 hrs late. When I got to Denver the board showed my flight to Fargo running 2 hrs late. After getting the run-around for 4 hrs from the United agents we finally boarded the plane to Fargo. After sitting on the runway for 45 minutes the pilot announced that they had to file a flight plan and it would be a few more minutes. 10 minutes later he announced that the crew was over their allowed hours for the day so they took us back to the gate and we went back into the terminal. There was no help from any of the agents. I had to be in Fargo the next morning so at considerable expense I booked a flight on Delta and got there the next day. Its a good thing I did because later that day I got a text message from United saying I was rebooked on a flight to Fargo for the next day which would have made me 2 days late on a 4 day trip. Needless to say this was my last trip on United.
10991,United Airlines,24-Feb-14,Canada,1,Economy,2,NO,New United seats are horrible. Flew 4 flights in economy plus recently. All flights had the new seats which have relatively no padding at all. I am a small guy and average weight and I was so uncomfortable after 20 minutes. United is making the seats lighter at the expense of our comfort. Shame on them. Not to mention United's poor customer service. You can spot a former Continental employee immediately as they are more friendly and competent.
10992,United Airlines,24-Feb-14,USA,1,Economy,1,YES,I recently flew with United from YEG (Edmonton) to EWR (Newark) and back in first class. The service I received in Edmonton and on board was excellent yet once I arrived in Newark the level of service decreased dramatically. I would recommend United for travelers yet I would say take caution flying through EWR.
